    "# Deploy Small Language Models Cost-efficiently with Amazon SageMaker and AWS Graviton\n",
    "\n",
    "As organizations look to incorporate AI capabilities into their applications, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for natural language processing tasks. [Amazon SageMaker AI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/whatis.html), AWS's fully managed machine learning service, provides a platform for deploying these ML models with multiple inference options, allowing organizations to optimize for cost, latency, and throughput. However, the computational requirements and costs associated with running these large, powerful LLMs can be prohibitive:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Traditional LLMs with billions of parameters require significant computational resources, often necessitating GPU instances with substantial memory.\n",
    "- This computational intensity and cost have led to growing interest in smaller, more efficient language models that can run on CPU infrastructure while still delivering good performance for specific use cases.\n",
    "- [AWS Graviton processors](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/graviton/), specifically designed for cloud workloads, offer an optimal platform for running these quantized models, providing up to 50% better price performance compared to traditional x86-based instances for ML inference workloads.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll demonstrate how to deploy a qauntized [DeepSeek R1 distilled 8B model](https://huggingface.co/bartowski/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B-GGUF) on Amazon SageMaker AI using Graviton-based instances, highlighting the challenges of running large LLMs and the benefits of utilizing efficient language models on cost-optimized hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Architecture and Components\n",
    "Our solution leverages Amazon SageMaker with AWS Graviton3 processors to run small language models cost-efficiently. The key components include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Amazon SageMaker AI hosted endpoints for model serving\n",
    "* AWS  Graviton3-based instances (ml.c7g series) for computation\n",
    "* Llama.cpp  for CPU-optimized inference\n",
    "* Pre-quantized  GGUF format models\n",
    "\n",
    "[Llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) uses GGUF, a special binary format for storing the model and metadata. Existing models need to be converted to GGUF format before they can be used for the inference. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Deployment Process\n",
    "To deploy your model on SageMaker with Graviton, you'll need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create  a Docker container compatible with ARM64 architecture\n",
    "2. Package  your model and inference code\n",
    "3. Create  a SageMaker model\n",
    "4. Configure  and launch an endpoint\n",

    "To run the model on Graviton processor, you need to use a docker container that supports the instance instance and has necessary packages installed. With Amazon SageMaker, you can package your own algorithms that can then be trained and deployed in the SageMaker environment. This notebook guides you through an example on how to extend one of our existing and predefined SageMaker deep learning framework containers. You can find a [list of available pre-built containers here](https://github.com/aws/deep-learning-containers/blob/master/available_images.md).\n",

    "\n",
    "### Extending our PyTorch containers\n",
    "In this example we show how to package a prebuilt PyTorch container that supports Graviton instances, extending the SageMaker PyTorch container, with a Python example which works with the DeepSeek distilled model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How Amazon SageMaker runs your Docker container\n",
    "\n",
    "* Typically you specify a program (e.g. script) as an `ENTRYPOINT` in the Dockerfile, that program will be run at startup and decide what to do. The original `ENTRYPOINT` specified within the SageMaker PyTorch is [here](https://github.com/aws/deep-learning-containers/blob/master/pytorch/training/docker/1.5.1/py3/Dockerfile.cpu#L142).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Running your container during training\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, our SageMaker PyTorch container utilizes [console_scripts](http://python-packaging.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command-line-scripts.html#the-console-scripts-entry-point) to make use of the `train` command issued at training time. The line that gets invoked during `train` is defined within the setup.py file inside [SageMaker Containers](https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-containers/blob/master/setup.py#L48), our common SageMaker deep learning container framework. When this command is run, it will invoke the [trainer class](https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-containers/blob/master/src/sagemaker_containers/cli/train.py) to run, which will finally invoke our [PyTorch container code](https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-pytorch-container/blob/master/src/sagemaker_pytorch_container/training.py) to run your Python file.\n",

    "\n",
    "Hosting has a very different model than training because hosting is responding to inference requests that come in via HTTP. Currently, the SageMaker PyTorch containers [uses](https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-pytorch-container/blob/master/src/sagemaker_pytorch_container/serving.py#L103) our [recommended Python serving stack](https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-containers/blob/master/src/sagemaker_containers/_server.py#L44) to provide robust and scalable serving of inference requests:\n",

    "\n",
    "Amazon SageMaker uses two URLs in the container:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `/ping` receives `GET` requests from the infrastructure. Your program returns 200 if the container is up and accepting requests.\n",
    "* `/invocations` is the endpoint that receives client inference `POST` requests. The format of the request and the response is up to the algorithm. If the client supplied `ContentType` and `Accept` headers, these are passed in as well. \n",
    "\n",

    "* __`code`__ is the directory which contains our user code to be invoked.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this application, we install and/or update a few libraries, and copy one script in the container, which will be used as `ENTRYPOINT`. You may only need that many, but if you have many supporting routines, you may wish to install more and use more files.\n",

    "### Inference Recommender\n",
    "SageMaker Inference Recommender is the capability of SageMaker that reduces the time required to get machine learning (ML) models in production by automating load tests and optimizing model performance across instance types. You can use Inference Recommender to select a real-time inference endpoint that delivers the best performance at the lowest cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "Get started with Inference Recommender on SageMaker in minutes while selecting an instance and get an optimized endpoint configuration in hours, eliminating weeks of manual testing and tuning time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inference Recommender uses metadata about your ML model to recommend the best instance types and endpoint configurations for deployment. You can provide as much or as little information as you'd like but the more information you provide, the better your recommendations will be.\n",
    "\n",
    "ML Frameworks: `TENSORFLOW, PYTORCH, XGBOOST, SAGEMAKER-SCIKIT-LEARN`\n",
    "\n",
    "ML Domains: `COMPUTER_VISION, NATURAL_LANGUAGE_PROCESSING, MACHINE_LEARNING`\n",
    "\n",
    "Example ML Tasks: `CLASSIFICATION, REGRESSION, IMAGE_CLASSIFICATION, OBJECT_DETECTION, SEGMENTATION, MASK_FILL, TEXT_CLASSIFICATION, TEXT_GENERATION, OTHER`\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Select the task that is the closest match to your model. Chose `OTHER` if none apply.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need to create an archive that contains individual files that Inference Recommender can send to your SageMaker Endpoints. Inference Recommender will randomly sample files from this archive so make sure it contains a similar distribution of payloads you'd expect in production. Note that your inference code must be able to read in the file formats from the sample payload."
