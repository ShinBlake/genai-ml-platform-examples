Theme: Service Level Agreement Violations
Case Number: 7
--------------------------------------------------

**Scenario**: Dispute Over Service Level Agreement Violations

**Parties Involved**:  
1. **TechCore Solutions Inc.** (Service Provider)  
   - A technology firm that specializes in cloud-based data management and IT support services.   
2. **RetailMax Corporation** (Client)  
   - A retail company that relies on TechCore for its online sales platform and customer data management.

**Background**:  
In January 2023, TechCore Solutions and RetailMax Corporation entered into a Service Level Agreement (SLA) outlining the expected performance standards for IT services. Key provisions included uptime guarantees of 99.9%, a 12-hour response time for critical support issues, and a quarterly review of service metrics. In exchange for these commitments, RetailMax agreed to pay $50,000 annually.

**Key Issues of Contention**:

1. **Uptime Violations**:  
   In April 2023, TechCore experienced a significant outage that lasted 10 hours due to server failure, resulting in RetailMax’s online sales platform being completely inaccessible. RetailMax claimed that the SLA’s 99.9% uptime guarantee was violated, as the extended downtime equated to 99.8%. TechCore countered by arguing that the clause allows for planned maintenance, which was pre-notified and partially overlapped with the outage.

2. **Response Time Delays**:  
On three separate occasions in May and June 2023, RetailMax reported critical issues—specifically, payment processing failures that directly affected customer transactions. On each occasion, TechCore’s response time exceeded the guaranteed 12-hour frame, taking up to 24 hours to address the issues. RetailMax asserted that these delays led to lost sales and customer dissatisfaction. TechCore defended its response times, claiming that the issues were misclassified as "critical" by RetailMax and warranted longer resolution times.

3. **Quarterly Review Non-compliance**:  
The SLA stipulated that both parties would conduct quarterly reviews of the service metrics to discuss performance and areas for improvement. RetailMax alleges that the review originally scheduled for July 2023 was postponed multiple times by TechCore and did not occur until two months later. RetailMax views this as a neglect of obligations and believes it undermined their ability to address performance concerns proactively.

4. **Damages and Compensation**:  
In the wake of these issues, RetailMax calculated estimated losses due to the downtime and response delays at approximately $200,000, including lost sales and the cost of implementing temporary solutions. They are now demanding compensation from TechCore. However, TechCore claims that the outage resulted from an unforeseen natural event and that their standard policies exempt them from such liability.

**Conclusion**:  
The conflict centers on the interpretation of SLA clauses, the designation of service downtimes as force majeure events, and the determination of what constitutes a critical support issue. RetailMax seeks financial restitution and stricter adherence to SLA terms, while TechCore aims to mitigate liability under the predefined agreements. Both parties are considering mediation as a potential step to resolve the dispute amicably, though escalation to legal action remains on the table.
