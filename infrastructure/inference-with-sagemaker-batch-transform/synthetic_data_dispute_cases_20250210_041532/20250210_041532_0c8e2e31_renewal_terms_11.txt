**Contract Dispute Scenario: Renewal Terms**

**Parties Involved:**
- **Company A:** EcoTech Solutions, a software development firm providing custom solutions for renewable energy companies.
- **Company B:** GreenPower Corp., a renewable energy start-up focused on solar installation and maintenance.

**Background:**
In 2020, EcoTech Solutions and GreenPower Corp. entered into a two-year contract for the development of a proprietary software platform tailored for GreenPowerâ€™s operational needs. The contract explicitly outlined the project deliverables, timelines, payment terms, and provisions regarding renewal of the agreement upon expiry.

**Specific Details of the Dispute:**
As the expiration date of the contract approached in 2022, discussions about the renewal terms commenced. The original contract stated that, under mutually agreeable conditions, the contract would automatically renew for an additional two years unless either party provided a written notice of non-renewal at least three months prior to the expiration date.

**Key Issues:**
1. **Notice of Non-Renewal:** 
   GreenPower Corp. contends that they submitted the required written notice three months before the contract expired, specifying their intention not to renew due to dissatisfaction with the software's performance and a desire to seek other vendors. However, EcoTech Solutions claims they never received the notice and allege it was sent to the wrong email address.

2. **Performance Under the Current Contract:** 
   EcoTech Solutions argues that they fulfilled all deliverables and provided extensive support during the contract term. They cite feedback received during the project milestones, which they believe evidenced GreenPower's satisfaction. On the other hand, GreenPower argues that the software frequently malfunctioned, resulted in operational delays, and did not meet several essential performance benchmarks, justifying their decision not to renew.

3. **Dispute Over Automatic Renewal:** 
   EcoTech asserts that, without the timely notice of non-renewal, the contract is automatically extended for another two years. This claim is contested by GreenPower, which argues that the automatic renewal clause was contingent upon satisfactory performance by EcoTech. They maintain that the underperformance constitutes valid grounds for rejecting the renewal.

4. **Damages and Legal Fees:** 
   GreenPower is seeking legal counsel regarding claims for damages incurred due to the software issues, including lost revenue and increased operational costs from hiring a competitor to address their software needs. EcoTech, meanwhile, contends it has incurred costs related to the development and support of the system, and seeks to recover fees owed for services rendered under the initial contract, regardless of the dispute over renewal.

**Current Status:**
As of October 2022, both parties have exchanged letters outlining their positions but have yet to reach a resolution. GreenPower has considered litigation as a means to address the disputes over both the contract interpretation and the service provided by EcoTech, while EcoTech is exploring mediation to avoid the costs associated with a prolonged legal battle. The situation remains tense, with potential implications for both companies' futures in a competitive market.
