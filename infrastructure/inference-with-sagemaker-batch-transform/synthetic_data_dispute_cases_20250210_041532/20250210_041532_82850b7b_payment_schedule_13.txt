**Contract Dispute Scenario: Payment Schedule**

**Parties Involved:**

1. **ABC Construction Co.** (Contractor) - A mid-sized construction firm specializing in residential projects.
2. **Greenwood Properties, LLC** (Client) - A real estate development company managing a new housing project.

**Project Overview:**
ABC Construction Co. was contracted by Greenwood Properties to build a 60-unit residential development in Maplewood, with a total contract value of $3 million. The contract was signed on April 1, 2023, and stipulated a phased payment schedule based on the completion of certain milestones.

**Payment Schedule Details:**
The contract outlined the following payment milestones:
- **20% upon signing** (Payment 1) - $600,000
- **30% upon completion of foundation** (Payment 2) - $900,000
- **25% upon completion of framing** (Payment 3) - $750,000
- **25% upon final inspection and completion** (Payment 4) - $750,000

**Key Issues in the Dispute:**

1. **Delayed Milestone Completion:**
   By September 30, 2023, ABC Construction had completed the foundation, but due to unforeseen labor shortages and delivery delays of critical materials (specifically, timber and roofing supplies), the framing was not completed until November 15, 2023. As a result, Greenwood Properties withheld Payment 2, arguing that completion deadlines were not met as per the contract.

2. **Change Order Controversy:**
In early October, during the framing phase, Greenwood Properties requested several change orders which altered the scope of work, including upgraded materials for roofing and additional structural reinforcements. ABC Construction estimated the cost of these changes at an additional $200,000. Greenwood Properties claimed the delay caused by the change orders justified withholding Payment 2.

3. **Ambiguity in Contract Language:**
Both parties point to ambiguous language in the contract regarding what constitutes "completion" of a milestone. ABC Construction argues that the foundation was completed to code, thus justifying the release of Payment 2, while Greenwood contends that "completion" also includes the readiness to proceed to subsequent phases without further complications.

4. **Communication Breakdown:**
Throughout the project, the parties experienced significant communication issues. ABC Construction alleges that Greenwood Properties did not provide timely feedback on change order requests, impacting the schedule. Conversely, Greenwood claims that ABC Construction failed to update them on potential risks regarding delays, leading to inadequate planning on their part.

**Conclusion:**
As of December 1, 2023, no further payments have been made, leading to strained relations and potential legal action. ABC Construction has threatened to file a mechanics lien, while Greenwood Properties is considering invoking a breach of contract claim, asserting that the delays in framing were egregious and warrant a significant penalty. Both parties are now pursuing mediation to resolve the payment dispute and recover from the delays in construction.
