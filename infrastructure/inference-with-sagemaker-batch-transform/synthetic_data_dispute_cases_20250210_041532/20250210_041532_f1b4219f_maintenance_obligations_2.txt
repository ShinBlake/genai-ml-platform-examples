Theme: Maintenance Obligations
Case Number: 2
--------------------------------------------------

**Scenario Overview:**

**Parties Involved:**  
1. **GreenSky Management, Inc.** - a property management firm responsible for maintaining residential properties.  
2. **Lakeview Apartments Association** - a homeowners' association representing the residents of the Lakeview Apartments complex.

**Background:**

In 2020, GreenSky Management entered into a two-year maintenance contract with Lakeview Apartments Association, which covered regular maintenance services, emergency repairs, landscaping, and common area upkeep for the complex. The contract stipulated that GreenSky was responsible for all maintenance tasks unless explicitly outlined as the responsibility of the association in the agreement.

**Key Issues in Dispute:**

1. **Scope of Maintenance Services:**  
   As the contract neared its expiration in 2022, Lakeview Apartments Association raised concerns about the adequacy of GreenSky's services. Residents reported that common areas, including hallways, the community pool, and the landscaping had been neglected. The association argued that GreenSky was not fulfilling its obligations per the terms outlined in the contract, specifically citing Clause 3, which specifies regular cleaning and upkeep schedules.

2. **Emergency Repairs Response Time:**  
Another contentious issue involved emergency repairs, particularly related to plumbing and electrical systems. Lakeview claimed that GreenSky consistently failed to respond within the agreed-upon 24-hour timeframe for emergency reports, leading to significant inconvenience for residents and even costly damage in some instances. GreenSky countered that they had responded within a reasonable time frame, considering the complexity of the repairs. However, Lakeview provided multiple instances where the response exceeded three days.

3. **Landscaping Quality and Frequency:**  
The contract stipulated that landscaping would occur bi-weekly. Residents observed that landscaping services had been reduced to monthly visits, resulting in overgrown gardens and unkempt common areas. Lakeview presented photographic evidence but GreenSky disputed this, claiming that the frequency was adjusted during the height of the pandemic due to labor shortages, which was communicated via email. Lakeview insisted that no formal amendment to the contract was ever executed to allow this change.

4. **Liability for Damages:**  
Finally, a dispute arose regarding responsibility for damage to the poolâ€™s filtration system that occurred in the middle of summer 2022. GreenSky claimed the damage was due to the association's failure to maintain the pool area, as outlined in Clause 5 of the contract, which placed certain maintenance decisions on the association. However, Lakeview maintained that they had followed all guidelines and believed the issue stemmed from GreenSky's failure to conduct necessary repairs that should have been performed months before the incident.

**Conclusion:**

Both parties found the disputes increasingly contentious, leading to a strained working relationship. Lakeview Apartments Association sought legal counsel to address the perceived breach of contract and potentially terminate their agreement with GreenSky Management, while GreenSky prepared to defend its service level and operational decisions, arguing that the pandemic had required flexibility in maintenance schedules. Both sides agreed to mediation to resolve their differences before considering litigation, with the goal of restoring trust and ensuring resident satisfaction.
