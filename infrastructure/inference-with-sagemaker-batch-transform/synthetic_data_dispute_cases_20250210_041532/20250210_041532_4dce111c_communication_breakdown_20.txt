Theme: Communication Breakdown
Case Number: 20
--------------------------------------------------

**Contract Dispute Scenario: Communication Breakdown**

**Parties Involved:**
1. **TechWave Solutions Inc.** - A software development company based in San Francisco, specializing in custom application development for small and medium enterprises.
2. **GreenBuild Construction Ltd.** - A construction company based in Los Angeles, contracted to develop sustainable buildings.

**Overview:**
In January 2023, TechWave Solutions and GreenBuild Construction signed a contract for the development of a project management application tailored for GreenBuild’s construction projects. The application was to streamline workflow, manage project timelines, and facilitate real-time communication among team members. The contract outlined a delivery date of June 30, 2023, with a payment plan upon milestones.

**Key Issues:**

1. **Ambiguity in Specifications:**
   The contract lacked clear specifications regarding the functionalities required in the project management application. Initial discussions led to a general outline, but various features, such as integration capabilities with existing software and user interface design, were not adequately documented. As development progressed, disagreements erupted between both parties over the expected deliverables.

2. **Delay in Feedback Cycle:**
TechWave’s project manager, Sarah, consistently reached out to GreenBuild for feedback during the testing phases. However, due to internal communication issues at GreenBuild, particularly involving their project lead, Tom, responses were often delayed or vague. This led to misinterpretations of GreenBuild’s requirements, resulting in a product that did not align closely with their expectations.

3. **Failure to Document Changes:**
Midway through the project, GreenBuild requested several additional features not originally discussed, including a mobile-friendly version of the application. Though informal discussions took place, no formal amendment to the original contract was made to reflect these changes. TechWave’s assumption was that these features would be additional costs, while GreenBuild believed they were part of the original scope.

4. **Discrepancies in Payment Schedule:**
Per the contract, TechWave was to receive payments at specific milestones. However, due to delays caused by communication breakdowns and scope misalignment, TechWave delivered a partial product on the original schedule, expecting partial payment. GreenBuild refused payment, claiming the delivered product did not meet the discussed specifications, based on their understanding of functionalities, further inflaming tensions.

5. **Final Delivery and Frustration:**
As the delivery date approached, both parties convened to reconcile their differences. TechWave delivered the final version but with features that were still misaligned with GreenBuild’s expectation due to the previous miscommunications. GreenBuild, frustrated and feeling shortchanged, declared that they would not accept the final product without necessary amendments. This led to a complete breakdown of negotiations, with GreenBuild threatening legal action for breach of contract.

**Conclusion:**
The dispute stems from a fundamental communication breakdown between TechWave and GreenBuild, aggravated by ambiguities in contractual language and insufficient documentation of changes throughout the project. The failure to establish a clear line of communication and to formally document revisions ultimately jeopardized the project’s success and caused significant friction, leaving both parties at an impasse.
