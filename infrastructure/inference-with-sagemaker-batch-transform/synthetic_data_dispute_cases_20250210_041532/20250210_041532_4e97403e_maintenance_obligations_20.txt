Theme: Maintenance Obligations
Case Number: 20
--------------------------------------------------

**Contract Dispute Scenario: Maintenance Obligations**

**Parties Involved:**

1. **ABC Property Management, Inc.** (Landlord)
   - An established property management firm that oversees multiple residential and commercial properties.
  
2. **XYZ Tenants, LLC** (Tenant)
   - A small business that rents a commercial space in one of ABC Property Management's buildings.

**Background:**

In June 2021, ABC Property Management entered into a three-year lease agreement with XYZ Tenants for an office space located in a mixed-use development. The lease stipulated specific maintenance obligations for both parties, categorized as follows:

1. **Landlord’s Responsibilities**: The landlord agreed to maintain the structural integrity of the building, ensure functionality of critical systems (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning - HVAC), and perform routine exterior maintenance.

2. **Tenant’s Responsibilities**: The tenant was responsible for interior maintenance, including plumbing fixtures, appliances, and any repairs necessitated by their operation.

**Key Issues of Dispute:**

1. **HVAC System Failure**: 
   - In August 2023, the HVAC system malfunctioned, leading to uncomfortable temperatures in the office space. XYZ Tenants reported the issue immediately, but ABC Property Management failed to respond within the agreed-upon 48-hour timeline for non-emergency repairs.
   - XYZ Tenants assert that the landlord’s negligence caused financial losses, including a decrease in customer visits due to the uncomfortable environment.

2. **Lack of Routine Maintenance**:
   - XYZ Tenants claim that ABC Property Management neglected its obligations for routine exterior and structural maintenance, leading to significant water damage during an unexpected rainstorm in September 2023. The tenant argues that leaks from the roof went unaddressed for months, creating mold and structural issues that necessary repairs have yet to resolve.

3. **Disputed Repair Costs**:
   - Following the HVAC failure and water damage, XYZ Tenants undertook emergency repairs to mitigate losses. They paid for an urgent HVAC repair and remedial work for the water damage, amounting to $12,000.
   - The tenant seeks reimbursement from ABC Property Management, claiming these repairs should have been covered under the landlord's maintenance obligations. The landlord, however, argues that the nature of the repairs exceeded the scope of their responsibilities, citing a lack of proper notice from the tenant regarding maintenance issues.

4. **Length of the Notice Period**:
   - Both parties disagree on the interpretation of the notice period required for maintenance issues to be addressed. The tenant argues they followed the prescribed notification procedures per the lease, while the landlord counterclaims that notice was not timely or sufficiently documented.

**Conclusion:**
The dispute escalated when XYZ Tenants filed a formal complaint, seeking damages for lost business, reimbursement for repair costs, and a renegotiation of lease terms due to the ongoing maintenance issues. ABC Property Management contends that they have fulfilled their obligations as outlined in the lease, denying responsibility for the tenant’s incurred costs. This deadlock has led both parties to consider mediation to resolve their differences and restore their business relationship.
