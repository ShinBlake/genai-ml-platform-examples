Theme: Notice Requirements
Case Number: 16
--------------------------------------------------

**Scenario Title: Notice Dispute in Commercial Lease Agreement**

**Parties Involved:**
1. **Landlord:** Green Oak Properties, LLC, a real estate management company specializing in commercial leases.
2. **Tenant:** Bright Star Medical Supplies, Inc., a retail supplier of medical equipment operating in a leased storefront.

**Background:**
In July 2021, Bright Star Medical Supplies entered into a three-year lease with Green Oak Properties for a retail space located in a busy commercial district. The lease contained a clause requiring the landlord to provide written notice at least 60 days before terminating the lease due to tenant violations or non-renewal.

**Key Issues:**

1. **Notice Delivery Method:**
   In September 2023, Green Oak Properties prepared a notice of non-renewal, stating that Bright Star had violated the lease terms by failing to maintain the storefront and allowing excessive signage not permitted in the lease. The notice was sent via email and posted at the storefront but was not mailed as a hard copy, despite the lease stipulating that any notices must be delivered to the tenant's registered business address by certified mail, in addition to any electronic methods.

2. **Timing of the Notice:**
   Bright Star received the email notice on September 15, 2023, and was informed that the lease would terminate on November 15, 2023. Bright Star contends that the notice is invalid because it did not provide the required 60-day period from the receipt of notice to the termination date. The tenant argues that proper notice under the lease would require the 60-day notice period to take effect from the manner in which the notice was legally delivered.

3. **Violation Allegations:**
   Bright Star disputes the allegations of lease violations, claiming that they were not in breach of the lease agreement. They argue that the signage was pre-approved during initial discussions and that they maintained the storefront according to industry standards. In response, Green Oak asserts that the terms of the lease were clear and the violations warranted termination.

4. **Communication Breakdown:**
   There were previous informal communications between the parties regarding the condition of the storefront and signage. Bright Star contends that these conversations indicated a mutual understanding that no action would be taken against them pending further discussions. Green Oak argues that these informal discussions did not constitute formal notifications or amendments to the lease.

**Outcome:**
The situation escalated as Bright Star sought legal advice, claiming wrongful termination of the lease based on inadequate notice and disputing the alleged lease violations. They filed a motion to prevent eviction, asserting that they should be allowed to continue operating their business due to Green Oakâ€™s failure to adhere to the notice requirements explicitly outlined in the lease agreement.

**Conclusion:**
The critical contentions center around the adequacy of notice delivery, the proper interpretation of the notice period, the legitimacy of alleged lease violations, and the expectations set by prior communications. This dispute raises fundamental questions about compliance with notice requirements and the implications of lease terms on both parties' rights and responsibilities.
