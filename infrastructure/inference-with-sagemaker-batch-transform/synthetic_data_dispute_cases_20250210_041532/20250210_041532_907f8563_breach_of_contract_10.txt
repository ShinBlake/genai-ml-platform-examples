Theme: Breach of Contract
Case Number: 10
--------------------------------------------------

**Scenario: Breach of Contract in a Construction Project**

**Parties Involved:**
1. **Greenleaf Construction, Inc.** (Contractor) - A mid-sized construction firm hired to build a commercial office complex.
2. **Sunset Realty Group, LLC** (Client) - A real estate development company responsible for financing and overseeing the project.

**Contract Details:**
The parties entered into a written contract on March 1, 2023, stipulating that Greenleaf Construction would complete the office complex by September 30, 2023, for a total agreed price of $2 million. The contract included a detailed timeline with milestones, penalties for delays, and a stipulation that any changes to the project scope must be documented and agreed upon in writing.

**Key Issues:**

**1. Delay in Project Completion:**
By mid-June 2023, Sunset Realty Group began to notice significant delays in the construction. According to the project timeline, the initial framing and foundation work should have been completed by May 15, but inspections revealed that only 50% of the work was finished at that time. Sunset Realty issued a formal complaint on June 20; Greenleaf cited supply chain issues as the main reason for the disruptions.

**2. Quality of Work:**
As work resumed, representatives from Sunset Realty observed inconsistencies in the quality of materials being used. The contract specified that specific brands and grades of materials must be utilized for the project to meet building codes and aesthetic standards. Instead, it was reported that Greenleaf was using lower-grade materials to cut costs, which violated the contractual terms. Sunset filed a complaint regarding the substandard quality of the work on July 15.

**3. Change Orders and Additional Costs:**
On July 30, Sunset Realty requested a change order to address minor adjustments in the design that were agreed upon during preliminary meetings. However, when they received the new budget, Greenleaf included a substantial increase of $300,000 in costs due to alleged additional work required to accommodate the changes. Sunset Realty contested this, asserting that the changes were within the scope of the original contract, which did not stipulate substantial alteration or additional costs without written agreement.

**4. Communication Breakdowns:**
Throughout the project, there were growing frustrations regarding communication between the two parties. Sunset Realty claimed that they often received little to no updates on project status, which left them feeling uninformed and caused delays in decision-making concerning project management. Greenleaf countered that all communications regarding project changes, including verbal updates, were noted and executed as per standard practice. 

**Resolution Attempts:**
In late August, Sunset Realty formally demanded a meeting with Greenleaf to discuss the delays, quality issues, and the unexpected increase in cost. They proposed a mediation session to address grievances and renegotiate terms. Greenleaf, however, pushed back, citing that they were indeed working within the bounds of the contract and were caught in unforeseen circumstances.

The tension between the parties continues to escalate, leading to the potential of a costly legal battle, unless both can find common ground or agree to engage in mediation to resolve their differences amicably.
