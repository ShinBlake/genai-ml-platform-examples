Theme: Notice Requirements
Case Number: 9
--------------------------------------------------

### Contract Dispute Scenario: Notice Requirements

#### Parties Involved:
1. **Alpha Construction Corp.** (“Alpha”) - A general contracting company engaged in residential and commercial construction projects.
2. **Greenwood Plaza LLC** (“Greenwood”) - A property management firm overseeing a large shopping center.

#### Background:
In June 2022, Alpha entered into a construction contract with Greenwood for the renovation of the Greenwood Shopping Center. The contract included specific clauses regarding notice requirements for delays, changes in scope, and claims for additional compensation. Notably, Section 9 of the contract stipulated that any party asserting a claim must provide written notice to the other party within ten business days of discovering the event necessitating the claim.

#### Dispute Overview:
In December 2022, Alpha encountered significant delays in delivering the project due to unexpected structural issues and supply chain disruptions. Following these challenges, Alpha submitted a request for an extension of the deadline along with claims for additional costs incurred. However, Alpha provided notice of its claim to Greenwood on January 15, 2023, which was over the stipulated ten business days from the date they identified the issues (December 29, 2022).

Greenwood disputes Alpha’s claim on the basis that the notice provided was untimely and therefore invalid under the contract’s notice requirements. They argue that proper notice was a fundamental condition for any changes to the timeline or financial terms of the contract.

#### Key Issues:
1. **Timeliness of Notice:**
   - Alpha argues that the delays were unprecedented and required additional time to assess the cost implications accurately. They believe that the notice period should be interpreted to accommodate such situations, thus justifying their delay in notification.
   - Greenwood maintains that the contract’s strict ten-day notice requirement must be upheld, regardless of the unforeseen circumstances. They assert that any modification to the contractually required notice period would undermine the enforceability of deadlines and planning.

2. **Nature of the Claims:**
   - Alpha claims both an extension of time and additional compensation for increased costs, including labor and materials. However, they did not provide detailed documentation until well after the notice deadline, raising concerns about the validity of the claims due to lack of supporting evidence at the time of notice.
   - Greenwood contends that without timely notice, they were deprived of the opportunity to mitigate delays and negotiate the terms effectively, which places undue burden on their operations and financial planning.

3. **Contractual Interpretation:**
   - The parties disagree on the interpretation of the notice clause. Alpha cites an implied requirement of good faith, arguing that external circumstances should allow for flexibility in notice windows.
   - Greenwood insists that the explicit terms of the contract must be followed, emphasizing that notice provisions are critical to maintaining clarity and accountability in contractual relationships.

#### Conclusion:
With both parties stubbornly entrenched in their positions, this dispute over notice requirements threatens to lead to litigation, as Alpha seeks enforcement of their claims while Greenwood prepares to deny any financial responsibility owing to the procedural breach. The resolution will likely hinge on whether courts uphold the strict contractual terms or consider equitable principles in light of the circumstances that impeded Alpha's compliance.
