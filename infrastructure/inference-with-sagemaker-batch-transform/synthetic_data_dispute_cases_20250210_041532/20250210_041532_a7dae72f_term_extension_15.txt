Theme: Term Extension
Case Number: 15
--------------------------------------------------

**Scenario Title: Contract Dispute Over Term Extension for Software Development Agreement**

**Parties Involved:**
1. **Tech Innovate Solutions (TIS)**: A software development company based in San Francisco, known for creating custom ERP solutions for small to medium enterprises.
2. **Retail Plus Inc. (RPI)**: A retail company specializing in e-commerce, located in Austin, Texas, which contracted TIS to develop an integrated software solution for inventory and sales management.

**Background:**
On January 15, 2022, TIS and RPI entered into a formal Software Development Agreement with an initial term of one year, encompassing specific project milestones and deliverables. The contract included provisions for potential extensions but required mutual agreement at least 30 days before the original term's expiration. The project was slated for completion by January 15, 2023, but unforeseen technical challenges prompted discussions about extending the project timeline.

**Key Issues at Dispute:**

1. **Points of Contention Over the Extension Request:**
   - **TIS’s Position**: TIS asserts that multiple unforeseen technical hurdles arose as they attempted to integrate RPI’s existing inventory systems with their new software. They formally requested a term extension on December 5, 2022, citing these issues as justifiable reasons for additional time needed to fulfill contract specifications. TIS claims RPI agreed verbally to a 60-day extension until March 15, 2023, during a phone call but failed to document this agreement.
   - **RPI’s Position**: RPI contests that no formal agreement extending the term was reached. RPI argues that their team was under the impression that TIS would meet the original deadline, given previous assurances. They insist that the lack of a documented extension means the original contract remains in effect, and as of January 15, 2023, TIS is in breach of contract.

2. **Deliverables and Final Payment:**
   - RPI has withheld the final installment of payment, amounting to $150,000, citing that TIS failed to deliver the complete software solution by the agreed-upon deadline. TIS contends that this action constitutes a breach on RPI's part, as they had communicated their challenges and the need for an extension.

3. **Legal and Financial Implications:**
   - Both parties are concerned about legal proceedings, as TIS is considering pursuing damages for lost revenue and reputational harm as a result of RPI's delay in payment. RPI, on the other hand, has threatened to seek damages for TIS's failure to deliver the product on time, which they claim has resulted in financial losses and missed business opportunities.

4. **Potential Resolutions:**
   - The primary points for resolution include reaching an agreement on the validity of the verbal extension, determining a reasonable time frame for project delivery, and addressing the outstanding payment issues. Both parties are exploring mediation as a potential means to resolve the dispute amicably prior to considering litigation.

The scenario presents a complex issue of contract interpretation, reliance on verbal agreements, and the impact of unforeseen changes on project timelines, emphasizing the critical need for clear communication and documentation in business agreements.
