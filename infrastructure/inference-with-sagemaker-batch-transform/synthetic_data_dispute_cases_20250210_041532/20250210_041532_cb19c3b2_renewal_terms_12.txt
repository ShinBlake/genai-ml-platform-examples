### Contract Dispute Scenario: Renewal Terms for Office Rental Agreement

**Parties Involved:**
1. **Landlord:** GreenField Properties LLC, a real estate management company owned by Janet Reynolds.
2. **Tenant:** TechSolutions Inc., a mid-sized software development firm represented by CEO Mark Thompson.

**Background:**
In 2021, GreenField Properties entered into a 3-year office rental agreement with TechSolutions Inc. The lease stipulated that the rent would be $5,000 per month for the first two years and an increase to $5,500 in the third year. The lease also included an option for renewal, stating that the tenant must notify the landlord of their intent to renew at least 90 days before the expiration of the lease. It also included a provision for a fair market rent adjustment based on the prevailing market conditions at the time of renewal.

**Timeline of Events:**
- **March 2024:** TechSolutions Inc. begins internal discussions about renewing the lease, determining their need for a larger space based on business growth.
- **May 1, 2024:** Mark Thompson sends an email to Janet Reynolds conveying their intent to renew the lease but requests a discussion about the terms given the potential need for adjustments in size and rent.
- **May 15, 2024:** Janet replies, confirming receipt of the renewal request but indicates that a fair market rent adjustment will take place as per the lease terms. She suggests a meeting to discuss this.
- **May 20, 2024:** A meeting is held, where Janet emphasizes that the market rent for similar properties in the area has risen significantly and proposes a new monthly rent of $6,500, effective immediately upon renewal.
- **May 25, 2024:** Mark counters by suggesting that the rent should account for the rising vacancy rates in the neighborhood and proposes $6,000 per month.

**Key Issues of Dispute:**
1. **Market Rent Adjustment:** Janet argues that the escalation of rent to $6,500 is justified based on recent real estate trends, referencing local commercial real estate reports. Conversely, Mark contends that the appraisal for the rental market referenced therein does not account for the economic trends adversely affecting businesses in the area, positioning the proposal as unjustified.

2. **Omitted Terms:** Mark points out that during their original lease negotiations, there was an understanding that the renewal would also consider the tenant's business growth and potential space needs, implying varied terms for size and usage beyond simple rent increase. He argues that this understanding, though not documented, should be factored into their negotiations.

3. **Notification and Timing:** There is a dispute over whether TechSolutions properly notified the landlord within the required timeline. While Mark argues that his email meets the 90-day notice period, Janet insists that a formal written notice was essential due to their agreement's specifics, creating ambiguity over any deadlines.

4. **Extension of Term:** Janet wants to limit the renewal to an additional 12 months based on perceived market risks, while Mark wishes to negotiate a 2-year term for stability, as TechSolutions forecasts significant growth.

### Conclusion:
The dispute centers around the reasonableness of the proposed rent increase, the interpretation of renewal terms regarding space and economic conditions, and the adequacy of the notification about renewal intent. Both parties seek a resolution that balances GreenField's investment interests with TechSolutions' operational needs, demonstrating the complexity often present in commercial lease agreements.
