**Scenario: Maintenance Obligations Dispute Between Landlord and Tenant**

**Parties Involved:**  
1. **Landlord:** Thomas Blake, owner of an apartment complex known as Riverside Apartments.  
2. **Tenant:** Sarah Connors, a tenant residing in Apartment 3B of Riverside Apartments under a one-year lease agreement.

**Background:**  
Thomas Blake and Sarah Connors entered into a lease agreement on January 1, 2023, for a monthly rent of $1,200. The lease stipulated that the landlord is responsible for maintaining the common areas of the apartment complex, including hallways, landscaping, and outdoor lighting, while the tenant is responsible for the maintenance of appliances within the apartment. The agreement further included a general clause that required both parties to report maintenance issues "in a timely manner."

**Key Issues:**  
1. **Failure to Repair Common Areas:**  
   Sarah has repeatedly reported that the outdoor lighting in the complex has been malfunctioning since February 2023, creating safety concerns for tenants returning home at night. Despite several verbal and written communications, Thomas has not addressed the issue. Sarah claims she notified him via email and text on three separate occasions, with the last notice sent on July 10, 2023. On the other hand, Thomas argues that he was unaware of the repeated reports, stating that he had only received one email and dismissed it as a one-time problem.

2. **Neglected Landscaping:**  
In addition to the lighting issue, Sarah has raised complaints about the neglected landscaping, particularly overgrown shrubs that obstruct pathways. During a formal inspection in mid-July, a municipal inspector cited the complex for not maintaining these areas, which has further aggravated Sarah's concerns about the landlord's obligations. Thomas contends that he has contracted with a landscaping company that services the property bi-weekly, and thus he believes he is fulfilling his maintenance responsibilities. However, the last documented service was over a month ago, according to a review of service receipts.

3. **Impact on Tenant's Living Conditions:**  
Sarah argues that the failure to maintain the common areas has caused her significant distress and has negatively impacted her quality of life, influencing her decision to seek early termination of the lease. She claims that the lack of lighting poses a hazard, while the overgrown landscaping has created an unwelcoming and potentially dangerous environment. Sarah demands a reduction in her rent and compensation for the distress caused. 

4. **Landlordâ€™s Counterclaim:**  
In response to Sarah's requests for rent reduction and potential lease termination, Thomas alleges that Sarah has violated the lease agreement by delaying repair requests related to her kitchen appliances, specifically a leaking dishwasher. He asserts that had she reported this issue promptly, repairs could have been conducted sooner.

**Resolution Attempts:**  
Both parties have attempted mediation but have reached an impasse, as Sarah insists on financial compensation and improvements to maintenance issues, while Thomas maintains that he has met his obligations as outlined in the lease. The matter now stands unresolved, with potential litigation looming if an agreement cannot be reached.
