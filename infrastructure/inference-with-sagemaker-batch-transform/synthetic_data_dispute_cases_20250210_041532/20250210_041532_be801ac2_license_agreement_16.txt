Case Number: 16
--------------------------------------------------

**Scenario: License Agreement Dispute Between TechCorp and SoftSolutions**

**Parties Involved:**
1. **TechCorp, Inc.** (Licensor) - A software development company based in Seattle, WA, specializing in cloud-based solutions for businesses.
2. **SoftSolutions, LLC** (Licensee) - A start-up based in Austin, TX, that provides software consulting and implementation services using TechCorp's proprietary software.

**Background:**
In June 2022, TechCorp and SoftSolutions entered into a License Agreement granting SoftSolutions a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use TechCorp's software (hereafter referred to as “the Software”) for a period of three years. The agreement included provisions for annual licensing fees, support, and maintenance, as well as clauses governing the use of the Software in client projects.

**Key Issues:**
1. **Breach of Confidentiality Clause:**
   TechCorp alleges that SoftSolutions shared the Software's source code with an unauthorized third party, ViableTech, in October 2023. Under the License Agreement's confidentiality clause, SoftSolutions was strictly prohibited from sharing, redistributing, or publishing any parts of the Software without TechCorp's written consent. SoftSolutions denies the allegation, claiming the source code was never disclosed, arguing that the files shared were generic and contained no proprietary content.

2. **Payment of Licensing Fees:**
SoftSolutions contends that TechCorp has failed to provide the promised upgrades and technical support, which were stipulated in the License Agreement as part of the annual licensing fee ($50,000). In response, TechCorp argues that SoftSolutions has only partially paid the licensing fees for the second year and that the lack of support was due to SoftSolutions' failure to request assistance through the proper channels as outlined in the contract.

3. **Termination of Agreement:**
In November 2023, after TechCorp formally notified SoftSolutions of the alleged breach of confidentiality and the outstanding fees, TechCorp expressed intentions to terminate the License Agreement. SoftSolutions asserts that the termination is unwarranted, claiming that it is being punished for issues that stem from TechCorp's failure to provide adequate support and that they had been in discussion to resolve payment issues before TechCorp moved to terminate.

4. **Impact on Existing Clients:**
SoftSolutions argues that the termination of the License Agreement would jeopardize its ongoing projects with clients who depend on the Software, potentially resulting in significant financial losses. They assert that TechCorp’s decision to terminate the license is a retaliatory action based on claims that SoftSolutions is contesting in good faith.

**Additional Considerations:**
Both parties face the potential for substantial damages if the dispute continues. SoftSolutions may pursue claims for breach of contract if the court finds that TechCorp acted improperly by terminating the agreement without a justified cause. Conversely, TechCorp could seek for the enforcement of the license terms and damages resulting from the alleged breach of confidentiality and unpaid fees.

**Conclusion:**
This scenario illustrates the complexities of contractual relationships in the tech industry, emphasizing the need for clear communication and strict adherence to contractual obligations by both parties.
