**Contract Dispute Scenario: Payment Schedule Between ABC Construction and Green City Development**

**Parties Involved:**  
1. ABC Construction (Contractor): A mid-sized construction company hired for a residential development project.  
2. Green City Development (Client): A property development firm overseeing the construction of a new housing complex.

**Project Overview:**  
ABC Construction was contracted in January 2023 to build a residential complex consisting of 50 townhouses in Green City. The total contract value was $5 million, with a payment structure delineated in a detailed schedule based on project milestones.

**Payment Schedule Highlights:**  
- **Initial Deposit:** 10% upon contract signing ($500,000) – paid.  
- **Milestone 1:** 20% after foundation work completion ($1 million) – due in April 2023.  
- **Milestone 2:** 30% after framing and roofing completion ($1.5 million) – due in August 2023.  
- **Final Payment:** 40% upon project completion and client approval ($2 million) – due in November 2023.

**Dispute Overview:**  
The dispute emerged in August 2023, when ABC Construction completed the framing and roofing work, triggering the payment for Milestone 2. Green City Development, however, refused payment, citing delays in the project timeline due to alleged subpar work, which they asserted did not meet their quality standards.

**Main Points of Contention:**

1. **Quality of Work:**  
   Green City Development claims that the framing was not completed according to the specified architectural plans, leading to structural concerns. They provided a list of alleged deficiencies, including incorrect dimensions, improper materials used, and missing reinforcements. ABC Construction maintains that the work was performed to code and according to the contract specifications.

2. **Project Timeline:**  
ABC Construction documents indicate that the project has been staying within the originally outlined timeline, attributing minor delays to adverse weather conditions and supply chain issues, all of which were communicated promptly to Green City Development. In contrast, Green City argues that these delays have accumulated and are unjustifiable, especially as they resulted in increased costs for them due to holding the project back.

3. **Retainage Clause:**  
Another sticking point is a retainage clause mentioned in the contract, which stipulates that clients may withhold a certain percentage of payments (in this case, 10%) until the entire project is complete. Green City requests a deduction of funds from Milestone 2, arguing that significant work remains pending, whereas ABC claims the completion of Milestone 2 shouldn't be affected by the retainage since they are only holding back on final completion payments.

4. **Communication Breakdown:**  
There has been a notable lack of communication as tensions escalated, leading to misunderstandings over the completion of the milestones. ABC Construction has expressed frustration over not receiving timely feedback or formal complaints that could have been addressed before reaching the payment due date.

**Conclusion:**  
As both parties remain firm in their positions, they have agreed to engage in mediation to resolve the dispute regarding the payment for Milestone 2, while also clarifying the expectations going forward to ensure project completion adheres to the contract terms.
