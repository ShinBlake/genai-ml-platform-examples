**Contract Dispute Scenario: Notice Requirements Between ABC Construction and XYZ Developers**

**Parties Involved:**
- **ABC Construction**: A general contractor based in Springfield with a reputation for high-quality residential projects.
- **XYZ Developers**: A real estate development firm located in Springfield, known for their large-scale commercial projects.

**Background:**
In January 2023, ABC Construction entered into a contract with XYZ Developers to build a new commercial office complex, valued at $5 million. The contract included a detailed clause regarding notice requirements for claims related to delays, defects, or additional costs, specifically stating that any party wishing to assert a claim must provide written notice to the other party within ten business days of the event giving rise to the claim.

**Dispute Details:**
By late July 2023, ABC Construction encountered significant delays due to unexpected supply chain disruptions affecting the delivery of critical materials like steel and concrete. The contractor began experiencing escalating costs and missed several project deadlines. They believed that these delays were beyond their control and warranted additional compensation.

On August 10, 2023, ABC Construction formally notified XYZ Developers via email about the delays and their intention to claim additional costs. However, the email indicated that ABC had first learned of the issues on July 25, 2023, which was fifteen business days after the actual disruptions began. 

**Key Issues of Contention:**

1. **Timeliness of Notice**:
   - **ABC Construction’s Position**: ABC argues that the notice requirement should be interpreted flexibly, given the extraordinary circumstances caused by external market conditions and that the delay notification would have been worse had they waited until August 25 to act.
   - **XYZ Developers’ Position**: XYZ argues that the notice provided by ABC was clearly late. According to the contract, the ten-business-day requirement is strictly enforced, and any failure to comply with this timeline invalidates ABC's claims for additional costs.

2. **Nature of the Disruption**:
   - **ABC Construction’s Claim**: ABC contends that the supply chain issues were unforeseen and constituted a valid basis for delay, thus they should be entitled to compensation under the contract's force majeure clause, which allows for consideration in such events.
   - **XYZ Developers’ Contention**: XYZ asserts that ABC should have anticipated potential supply chain issues, especially in an environment post-COVID-19 where such risks were commonly discussed in the industry. They argue that proper risk management practices would not have led to this situation.

3. **Impacts on Project Completion**:
   - **ABC Construction**: ABC states that due to the delays and the resulting financial strain, they are unable to complete the project within the agreed timeline, which may trigger penalties outlined in the contract.
   - **XYZ Developers**: XYZ claims that improper handling of the delays by ABC has compromised the project schedule, leading to potential losses in tenant contracts and resulting in monetary damages.

**Conclusion**:
The dispute hinges primarily on the interpretation of the notice requirements and the reasons behind the delays. Both parties are preparing to engage in mediation to resolve these issues, emphasizing the importance of clear and timely communication in contractual obligations.
