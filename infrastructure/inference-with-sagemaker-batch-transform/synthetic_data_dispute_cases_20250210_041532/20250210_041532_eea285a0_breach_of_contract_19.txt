Case Number: 19
--------------------------------------------------

**Scenario: Dispute Over Breach of Contract in a Home Renovation Project**  

**Parties Involved:**  
- **Client:** Sarah Mitchell, a homeowner in Austin, Texas.  
- **Contractor:** Green Builders, LLC, a licensed general contracting company specializing in residential renovations.

**Background:**  
In May 2023, Sarah Mitchell signed a contract with Green Builders, LLC for a major renovation of her home, including kitchen remodeling, bathroom updates, and the installation of hardwood floors. The total contract value was $80,000, with a payment schedule that included a 30% deposit upfront ($24,000), 40% after the first phase of work (kitchen and bathroom), and the remaining 30% upon completion. The project was scheduled to last three months, with a completion date set for August 25, 2023.

**Key Issues of Dispute:**  

1. **Delay in Completion:**  
   By the end of August, Sarah noticed that the project was not complete. The kitchen and bathroom were only partially finished. Green Builders had missed various milestones outlined in the contract, contributing to the delays. Sarah reached out multiple times to inquire about the delays, receiving vague responses about material shortages and scheduling conflicts. As of September 1, 2023, the project was still at 60% completion.

2. **Quality of Work:**  
   After inspecting the work completed so far, Sarah identified several quality issues, including incomplete tiling, improperly installed fixtures, and unfinished cabinetry. These problems were clearly not in line with the specifications laid out in the contract. Sarah claimed that she had expected a certain level of craftsmanship given Green Builders' reputation but instead faced shoddy workmanship that required corrections.

3. **Failure to Communicate:**  
   Sarah expressed frustration over Green Builders' lack of communication. She argued that the contractor failed to provide regular updates or give her proper notice about delays or issues that affected the timeline. This left her feeling blindsided and uncertain about the project's progress.

4. **Payment Dispute:**  
   According to the contract, payment for the next phase of work was due once the kitchen and bathroom renovations were finished. Given the delay and the unsatisfactory quality, Sarah refused to pay the second installment of $32,000, which was due in late August. Green Builders has threatened to impose a lien on her property if she does not pay, claiming that they incurred additional costs due to delays.

5. **Damages and Legal Action:**  
   Sarah, feeling aggrieved, considers filing a formal complaint for breach of contract, seeking damages for her costs due to the delays and the necessity to hire another contractor to finish the work. Green Builders counters that the delays were due to unforeseen circumstances and that Sarahâ€™s refusal to pay breaches their contractual agreement.

**Conclusion:**  
This dispute over the breach of contract between Sarah Mitchell and Green Builders, LLC centers on the failure to complete work on time, quality issues, lack of communication, and payment disagreements. With both parties claiming damage, resolution may involve mediation or potentially escalating to legal proceedings, depending on the willingness of either side to negotiate a settlement.
