Theme: Service Level Agreement Violations
Case Number: 10
--------------------------------------------------

**Scenario: Contract Dispute Over Service Level Agreement Violations**

**Parties Involved:**
1. **Tech Solutions Inc. (TSI)** - A cloud-based software provider specializing in project management tools for enterprise clients.
2. **Global Enterprises Ltd. (GEL)** - A multinational corporation that relies on TSI's software for its project management across various departments.

**Background:**
In January 2023, TSI and GEL entered into a one-year contract that included a Service Level Agreement (SLA). The SLA stipulated that TSI would provide 99.9% uptime for its software services, defined response times for customer support requests (within 2 hours for critical issues), and regular system updates every quarter.

**The Dispute:**
By April 2023, GEL began noticing consistent issues with TSI’s software performance. Specifically, uptime began to dwindle, with several recorded outages resulting in 4% downtime over the first quarter of the year. These outages disrupted GEL's operations, causing significant delays in project timelines and leading to client dissatisfaction.

In addition, the support response times did not align with the SLA. GEL recorded multiple instances where critical support requests took an average of 5 to 6 hours to resolve instead of the promised 2 hours. These delays caused disruption in crucial project phases, further aggravating GEL’s operational setbacks.

In May, GEL sent a formal complaint to TSI detailing these violations and requesting financial penalties based on the SLA terms. The SLA stipulated that GEL was entitled to a credit equal to 10% of the monthly fee for every hour of downtime exceeding the agreed limit and for every prolonged response time incidence.

**Key Issues:**
1. **Downtime vs. SLA Commitment**: TSI claims that the outages were due to unforeseen technical challenges involving third-party integrations and that they are not liable for circumstances beyond their control. GEL counters that TSI is responsible for maintaining the quality of service outlined in the SLA, regardless of external factors.

2. **Support Response Times**: TSI argues that GEL's expectations might have been unrealistic and that internal miscommunication on GEL’s side contributed to the delay in issue escalation. GEL, however, has documented instances via their ticketing system that clearly show the late responses from TSI support, arguing that TSI did not uphold the agreed-upon response time.

3. **Financial Recompense**: GEL is seeking not just credits for service failures but is also considering claiming incidental damages, including lost revenue from projects that were delayed due to TSI’s service interruptions. TSI, on the other hand, is contending that their liability is limited strictly to credits for the service disruptions, as per the terms of the SLA, which also includes a clause limiting consequential damages.

**Resolution Attempts:**
GEL initiated an informal dispute resolution process, hoping to negotiate a mutually beneficial outcome, but TSI has been reluctant to offer substantial concessions. Both parties are now considering mediation to resolve the dispute without escalating to litigation, which could harm their respective reputations and business partnerships.
