Theme: Acceptance Criteria
Case Number: 7
--------------------------------------------------

**Contract Dispute Scenario: Software Development Project**

**Parties Involved:**
1. **Tech Innovations Inc.** - A mid-sized software development firm contracted to build a custom Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system for Green Acres Realty, a real estate agency.
2. **Green Acres Realty** - A real estate agency looking to streamline its operations with a new CRM system to manage client relationships effectively.

**Background:**
In January 2023, Green Acres Realty entered into a contract with Tech Innovations Inc. to design and implement a CRM system tailored to their business needs. The contract stipulated that specific Acceptance Criteria, which detailed the functionalities and performance metrics of the software, would be developed collaboratively during the project kick-off meeting.

**Key Issues:**
1. **Undefined Acceptance Criteria**: During the projectâ€™s initial stages, both parties held a meeting to outline the Acceptance Criteria. However, due to miscommunication, the final document lacked clarity. Key features such as automatic client follow-ups, data reporting capabilities, and mobile access were mentioned verbally but were not clearly documented in the finalized Acceptance Criteria. In August 2023, when the project was near completion, Green Acres Realty claimed that the delivered product did not meet their expectations based on the functionalities they believed were agreed upon.

2. **Change Requests**: Over the course of the project, Green Acres Realty requested several changes, including additional integrations with third-party applications and enhanced reporting features. Tech Innovations Inc. argued that these requests were outside the original scope and therefore, should have incurred additional costs and timeline adjustments. Green Acres Realty contended that since the original Acceptance Criteria were vague, they believed they were entitled to improvements without significant changes to the budget or timeline.

3. **Testing Phase Discrepancies**: As part of the project timeline, Tech Innovations Inc. completed a testing phase, during which they presented a demo to Green Acres Realty. The demo, however, highlighted several functionalities that did not align with what Green Acres Realty expected based on their understanding of the agreed-upon features from the initial meeting. When Green Acres insisted on further revisions, Tech Innovations claimed they had fulfilled their obligations under the contract, pointing to the vague Acceptance Criteria as a reason for non-compliance.

4. **Breach of Contract Claims**: As negotiations deteriorated, Green Acres Realty threatened to file a breach of contract claim against Tech Innovations Inc., alleging failure to deliver a product that matched their business needs as indicated in the discussions. They demanded a partial refund and additional time to fix the system themselves or through another vendor. In response, Tech Innovations asserted that Green Acres's lack of clarity on the Acceptance Criteria waived their right to any claims regarding the project deliverables.

**Conclusion:**
The dispute centers on the ambiguity of the Acceptance Criteria and the resulting implications on project scope, expectations, and deliverables. Both parties find themselves at a stalemate, requiring legal intervention or mediation to resolve the issues surrounding responsibility, scope changes, and reimbursement claims.
