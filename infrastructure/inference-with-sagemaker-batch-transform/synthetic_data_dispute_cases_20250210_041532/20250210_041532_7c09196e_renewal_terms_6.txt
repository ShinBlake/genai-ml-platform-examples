**Contract Dispute Scenario: Renewal Terms**

**Background:**
XYZ Manufacturing Inc. and ABC Supplies LLC entered into a three-year supply agreement in January 2021, where ABC Supplies was to provide a range of manufacturing materials to XYZ Manufacturing. The agreement included a clause addressing renewal terms, which stipulated that if neither party provided written notice at least 90 days before the expiration of the contract, the contract would automatically renew for an additional year. 

As the contract was set to expire in December 2023, XYZ Manufacturing, believing they had initiated renewal talks in September 2023, began sourcing new suppliers, anticipating that ABC Supplies would be willing to renegotiate due to the rising costs of raw materials.

**Parties Involved:**
1. **XYZ Manufacturing Inc.**: A leading manufacturing company specializing in electronic components. The procurement department is tasked with negotiating and managing supplier contracts.
2. **ABC Supplies LLC**: A supplier of raw materials, competing with other firms in the same market segment, facing challenges due to increasing raw material costs.

**Details of the Dispute:**
In early October 2023, ABC Supplies LLC sent a notification to XYZ Manufacturing asserting that the contract had automatically renewed for another year, based on the lack of a 90-day written notice from XYZ Manufacturing regarding non-renewal. The notice cited the contract's specific language regarding renewal and emphasized the need for written communication within the stated timeframe.

**Key Issues:**
1. **Communication**: XYZ Manufacturing contends that informal discussions held in September 2023 indicated that ABC Supplies was open to negotiating new terms. However, no formal written communication was sent, which ABC Supplies argues is necessary according to the contract.

2. **Intent to Renew or Not**: XYZ Manufacturing argues that the informal discussions were sufficient to demonstrate their intent not to renew and to initiate renegotiations. ABC Supplies refutes this by highlighting the contract's clear requirement for formal written notice.

3. **Market Conditions**: The parties are also at odds over the impact of market conditions on the potential renewal. XYZ Manufacturing is exploring new suppliers due to rising costs, which they believe should allow for more competitive terms, while ABC Supplies emphasizes that despite rising costs, they have consistently provided quality materials, warranting continuation without a price change.

4. **Timing of Notices**: Both parties disagree on the sequence of events leading up to the expiration of the contract. XYZ Manufacturing claims it was under the impression that discussions were ongoing and that a formal notice was unnecessary, while ABC Supplies points out that without a formal notice, the default renewal clause should apply.

**Conclusion:**
The dispute now hinges on whether XYZ Manufacturing's informal communication suffices to constitute notice of non-renewal and whether ABC Suppliesâ€™ interpretation of the contract's renewal terms is legally binding. Both parties are preparing for potential legal proceedings, aiming to settle the matter amicably before the end of December 2023.
