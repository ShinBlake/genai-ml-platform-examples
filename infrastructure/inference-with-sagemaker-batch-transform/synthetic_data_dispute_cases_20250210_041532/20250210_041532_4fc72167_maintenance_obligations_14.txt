Case Number: 14
--------------------------------------------------

**Contract Dispute Scenario: Maintenance Obligations**

**Parties Involved:**
1. **ABC Property Management, Inc. (ABC)** - A property management company responsible for the maintenance and oversight of several residential apartment buildings.
2. **Greenfield Apartments, LLC (Greenfield)** - The owner of a 50-unit residential apartment complex located in Riverside, CA.

**Background:**
In January 2022, ABC and Greenfield entered into a three-year property management agreement stipulating that ABC would be responsible for all maintenance tasks, including routine repairs, landscaping, and emergency services. The contract specifically outlined that ABC was to conduct regular inspections and keep a maintenance log for each unit, as well as a master maintenance schedule for the entire complex.

**Dispute Summary:**
In July 2023, Greenfield raised concerns about ABC's performance, citing multiple instances of inadequate maintenance that allegedly led to tenant complaints and reduced occupancy rates. The key points of contention in the dispute include the following:

1. **Negligence in Routine Inspections:**
   Greenfield claimed that ABC had failed to conduct the scheduled inspections for several months. In particular, the HVAC systems had not been checked as per the agreed semi-annual schedule, which led to multiple tenant complaints about heating failures during the winter months. The management contract required ABC to submit monthly reports on maintenance activities, which Greenfield argued were not provided consistently.

2. **Failure to Address Tenant Complaints:**
   Greenfield provided documentation illustrating that several urgent maintenance requests from tenants—such as plumbing leaks and electrical issues—were either ignored or handled with significant delays. These failures not only inconvenienced tenants but also led to additional damage to the property, resulting in higher repair costs that Greenfield contended were the responsibility of ABC under the terms of the contract.

3. **Landscaping and Outdoor Maintenance:**
   Greenfield accused ABC of neglecting outdoor maintenance responsibilities, which included regular landscaping, trash removal, and upkeep of the common areas. The property’s outdoor space had reportedly fallen into disarray, with overgrown weeds, uncollected trash, and broken outdoor furniture, detracting from the tenants' living conditions and the overall appeal of the property, which Greenfield believed affected tenant retention.

4. **Request for Compensation:**
   As a result of these perceived breaches of contract, Greenfield demanded compensation for lost rental income due to high vacancy rates and additional repair costs incurred from the lack of maintenance. Greenfield estimated losses at approximately $25,000 and sought to revise their agreement with ABC to include stricter performance metrics and penalties for future non-compliance.

**Conclusion:**
The dispute escalated to negotiations, with ABC contesting the claims, arguing that Greenfield had not adequately reported issues in real-time and that some maintenance challenges were exacerbated by factors outside their control, such as supply chain delays for repair parts. Both parties are now considering mediation as a means to resolve the disagreement amicably while retaining the existing contractual relationship.
