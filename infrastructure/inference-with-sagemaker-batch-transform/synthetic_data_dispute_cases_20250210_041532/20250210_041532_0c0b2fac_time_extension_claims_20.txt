Case Number: 20
--------------------------------------------------

**Contract Dispute Scenario: Time Extension Claims**

**Parties Involved:**
1. **Construction Co. LLC** ("Contractor"): A mid-sized construction firm based in Atlanta, Georgia, specializing in commercial real estate development.
2. **City of Atlanta** ("Owner"): The municipal body overseeing the construction of a new city hall building.

**Project Overview:**
The project in question is the construction of a new city hall, a contract valued at $5 million, with a stipulated completion date of December 15, 2023. The contractor agreed to complete the project within a 12-month timeline, with payment disbursements tied to specific project milestones.

**Dispute Details:**
As the project neared its completion date, the Contractor submitted a Time Extension Claim (T.E.C.) on October 5, 2023, requesting an extension of 90 days due to various unforeseen circumstances. This claim was based on the following key issues:

1. **Weather Delays**: The Contractor cited several weeks of rain during July and August, which they argued adversely impacted the construction schedule, particularly in areas requiring groundwork and foundation work.

2. **Supply Chain Disruptions**: The Contractor claimed delays in obtaining crucial building materials—specific concrete types and specialty HVAC units—resulting from global supply chain issues. They argued that these delays were exacerbated by their reliance on certain suppliers who failed to meet committed delivery dates.

3. **Design Change Orders**: The Contractor noted that they received multiple design change orders from the City’s project management team, which they claimed altered the intended timeline and scope of work. They argued that these changes required additional time for both planning and execution.

4. **Labor Shortages**: The Contractor provided documentation indicating a significant regional labor shortage, particularly in skilled trades. They argued that the inability to secure adequate labor delayed multiple critical activities within the construction timeline.

**Key Issues for Contention:**

1. **Justification of Time Extension**: The Owner contests the Contractor’s claims regarding weather delays, suggesting that the storm data provided only indicated average levels of rainfall consistent with historical trends. They argue that the weather-related delays do not justify a 90-day extension.

2. **Responsibility for Schedule Management**: The Owner claims that the Contractor failed to effectively manage schedules concerning the delivery of materials and project timelines, asserting that they should have anticipated potential supply chain issues and accounted for them within their project timeline.

3. **Documentation of Change Orders**: The Owner is skeptical of the Contractor's assertion regarding design changes causing significant delays. They argue that the Contractor did not adequately document how these changes affected the original schedule and point to delays unrelated to these changes.

4. **Labor Force Management**: The Owner disputes the Claim of labor shortages, suggesting that the Contractor could have hired subcontractors or utilized temporary labor firms to ensure steady progress on the project.

**Conclusion:**
Both parties remain at an impasse, with the Contractor insisting on the merit of their T.E.C. based on the claimed delays, while the Owner argues for the importance of adherence to contract terms. The City stands firm in refusing the extension, and both parties are now considering mediation to resolve the dispute before it escalates to litigation.
