Theme: Breach of Contract
Case Number: 1
--------------------------------------------------

**Contract Dispute Scenario: Breach of Contract**

**Parties Involved:**

1. **ABC Construction, Inc.** (Plaintiff) - A mid-sized construction firm specializing in residential projects based in Portland, Oregon.
2. **XYZ Development Corp.** (Defendant) - A real estate development company known for urban residential projects.

**Background:**

In January 2023, ABC Construction, Inc. entered into a contract with XYZ Development Corp. to build a 50-unit residential complex in downtown Portland. The total contract value was $5 million, with a stipulated completion date of December 15, 2023. According to the contract, 20% of the total fee was to be paid upfront, followed by progress payments based on the completion of specified milestones throughout the project.

**Key Issues:**

1. **Delay in Startup:**
   ABC Construction experienced unexpected delays in obtaining the necessary permits from the City of Portland, which postponed the project start date from February 1, 2023, to April 15, 2023. Due to this delay, ABC notified XYZ of the situation and requested a contractual extension. XYZ Development, however, insisted that ABC should absorb any cost implications from the delay, claiming the delays were due to poor project management on ABC’s part.

2. **Quality Concerns:**
   As construction progressed, XYZ Development raised concerns regarding the quality of the work being performed by ABC. They claimed that the concrete used for the foundation did not meet the required specifications outlined in the contract. ABC countered that XYZ approved the materials during inspections and that the concrete was certified through an established vendor.

3. **Change Orders:**
   Midway through the project, XYZ requested several change orders that significantly altered the project's scope, including adding common areas and modifying the layouts of some units. ABC Construction complied with the requests but later claimed that XYZ was slow to approve the change orders, leading to further delays and additional costs that exceeded the original budget. XYZ disputed these claims, arguing that ABC had failed to submit change orders in a timely manner and therefore should not be compensated for the resulting costs.

4. **Payment Disputes:**
   As of September 2023, ABC Construction completed 70% of the project but had only received 50% of the total payment due to XYZ’s ongoing concerns about quality and the status of change orders. ABC linked the non-payment to XYZ's breach of contract and threatened to halt construction, leading to a stalemate and further complications.

**Conclusion:**

The relationship between ABC Construction and XYZ Development has severely deteriorated due to these various points of contention. ABC alleges that XYZ's refusal to process appropriate payments and acceptance of quality work, along with their unapproved scope changes, constitutes a breach of contract, leading to significant financial strain on their operations. XYZ counters that ABC's delays, quality failures, and issues with change orders justify withholding payments. As the completion deadline approaches, both parties are considering legal action, which could lead to prolonged disputes and financial losses for both sides.
