Case Number: 2
--------------------------------------------------

**Contract Dispute Scenario: Web Development Project**

**Background:**
In January 2023, TechSolutions Inc., a web development company, entered into a contract with EcoRetail Corp., an eco-friendly retail company, to design and develop a new e-commerce website. The project budget was $150,000, with a timeline of six months, and stipulated that the website should incorporate specific functionalities, including a user-friendly interface, a robust search engine, a shopping cart, and an integrated payment gateway. 

**Parties Involved:**
1. **TechSolutions Inc.** - The developer responsible for creating the website.
2. **EcoRetail Corp.** - The client, seeking a fully functional e-commerce platform to boost online sales.

**Key Issues:**

1. **Acceptance Criteria Confusion:**
   At the project outset, the contract outlined several acceptance criteria that the final product needed to meet for EcoRetail Corp. to consider the project complete. However, the criteria were vaguely defined. For instance, phrases like “user-friendly” and “robust” were not quantified, leading to differing interpretations. EcoRetail Corp. expected an intuitive design with easy navigation, while TechSolutions focused on the functionality of the system without emphasizing usability metrics.

2. **Feature Misalignment:**
   Midway through the project, EcoRetail Corp. reviewed a prototype and expressed dissatisfaction, claiming that the search engine did not return relevant results and that the shopping cart was difficult to navigate. TechSolutions asserted that the search engine met the initial requirements stated in the contract (functionality only), while EcoRetail contended that user experience was integral to “robustness” and thus a necessary aspect of the acceptance criteria.

3. **Delayed Deliverables:**
   Due to ongoing revisions arising from disagreements over the acceptance criteria, TechSolutions fell two months behind schedule. EcoRetail Corp. expressed frustration, asserting that the delays were primarily due to TechSolutions not adhering to the contractually agreed timelines. TechSolutions responded that the delays were a result of EcoRetail’s evolving requirements, which were often communicated informally and not documented.

4. **Increased Costs:**
   Following the delays and the expanded scope of requested features, TechSolutions submitted an amendment to the contract requesting an additional $30,000 for the extra development work. EcoRetail Corp. contested this amount, arguing that the additional features were implied in the original objectives and that TechSolutions had not fulfilled the acceptance criteria as outlined. They felt that asking for more money was unreasonable given the ongoing issues with the project.

5. **Communication Breakdown:**
   Throughout the project, both parties failed to maintain clear lines of communication regarding expectations. Weekly meetings, intended to resolve concerns, often devolved into contentious discussions, further straining the working relationship. EcoRetail alleged that TechSolutions was dismissive of their feedback, while TechSolutions believed EcoRetail was indecisive about requirements.

**Conclusion:**
The situation has escalated to the point where EcoRetail Corp. is considering pursuing legal action for breach of contract, claiming that TechSolutions did not deliver a product that met the agreed acceptance criteria, while TechSolutions is contemplating initiating its own counterclaim for additional costs incurred due to delays and scope changes. Both parties now face the prospect of extensive legal proceedings to resolve these disputes, highlighting the critical importance of clear acceptance criteria in contractual agreements.
