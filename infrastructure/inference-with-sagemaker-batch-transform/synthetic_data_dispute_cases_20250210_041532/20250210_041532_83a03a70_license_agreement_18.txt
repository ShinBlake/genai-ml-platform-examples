Case Number: 18
--------------------------------------------------

**Contract Dispute Scenario: License Agreement between Tech Solutions Inc. and ApplyWare LLC**

**Parties Involved:**

1. **Tech Solutions Inc. (TSI)**: A software development company specializing in custom applications for businesses.
2. **ApplyWare LLC (AW)**: A startup that provides a mobile application for workforce management and task tracking.

**Background:**

In January 2023, TSI and AW entered into a licensing agreement that allowed AW to use TSI's workforce management software (referred to as "WorkTrack Pro") under specific terms. The agreement granted AW exclusive rights to use, modify, and distribute WorkTrack Pro in North America for five years, in exchange for an upfront license fee of $500,000 and a 10% royalty on all revenue generated from the software.

**Dispute Details:**

By late September 2023, AW had launched its mobile application, which integrated WorkTrack Pro functionalities. However, TSI subsequently accused AW of breaching the license agreement on several counts, leading to a significant dispute:

**Key Issues:**

1. **Scope of Modification Rights**: TSI contended that AW made unauthorized modifications to the core functionalities of WorkTrack Pro. AW had integrated additional features that, according to TSI, exceeded the rights outlined in the license agreement, effectively creating a new version of the software without TSI’s consent.

2. **Revenue Reporting and Royalty Payments**: TSI claimed that AW failed to provide accurate revenue reports and, consequently, underreported its software-related income. TSI alleged that AW's reported revenue for the first quarter was $300,000, while TSI believed the actual revenue was at least $450,000. This discrepancy caused a conflict regarding the owed royalties, creating tensions about financial accountability.

3. **Geographical Restrictions**: TSI pointed out that the license agreement explicitly stated that AW’s rights were limited to North America. However, TSI claimed they had evidence that AW was promoting the software to potential clients in Europe through online ads. TSI argued that this violated the geographical limitations of the agreement.

4. **Termination Clause**: Following these disputes, TSI issued a notice of termination to AW, arguing that the breaches warranted such action under contractual provisions. AW countered that TSI acted prematurely and that disputes of this nature should have been resolved through mediation before termination could be justified.

5. **Intellectual Property Concerns**: TSI accused AW of infringing its intellectual property rights by leveraging WorkTrack Pro in a way that confused consumers and presented the software as wholly owned by AW. TSI claimed this not only damaged its brand but also risked legal implications with other partners.

**Conclusion:**

As the parties moved toward litigation, both sides argued for their interpretation of the license agreement. TSI sought not only for AW to cease its current practices but also for financial compensation for the alleged losses incurred. AW, on the other hand, defended its actions, claiming innovative modifications added significant value and that they had complied with the agreement. At this stage, both companies were considering alternative dispute resolution methods to avoid the costs and complexities of court proceedings.
