Case Number: 7
--------------------------------------------------

**Contract Dispute Scenario: Time Extension Claims**

**Parties Involved:**
1. **ABC Construction Corp.** (Contractor)
2. **City of Riverton** (Owner)

**Project Overview:**
The dispute arises from a $5 million municipal infrastructure project awarded to ABC Construction Corp. by the City of Riverton. The project involves the renovation of a dilapidated downtown park, which includes the installation of new pathways, lighting, and landscaping. The contract stipulated a completion date of September 30, 2023, with a penalty clause for delays resulting in deductions from the final payment.

**Key Issues:**

1. **Delayed Permits:**
   ABC Construction claims that the City significantly delayed the issuance of necessary construction permits by more than two months. The contractor asserts that they submitted all required documentation on time, yet the City’s Department of Planning did not complete its review until late June 2023. The contractor argues that this delay, caused by internal staffing shortages and a backlog of permits, hindered their ability to start work on time.

2. **Weather-Related Delays:**
   The contractor also cites unforeseen weather conditions as a cause for the delays. They assert that heavy rainfall in July 2023 made certain parts of the park unsafe for excavation and construction. The contractor claims that they lost three weeks of productive work due to these conditions, which were not accounted for in the original schedule.

3. **Change Orders:**
   A significant point of contention revolves around three change orders issued by the City during the project. These changes included modifications to the lighting plan and the addition of a new playground area. ABC Construction argues that these changes not only affected the timeline but also imposed additional costs, which were not fully compensated. The contractor maintains that the increase in scope warranted a formal time extension and additional funding.

4. **Communication Breakdown:**
   Throughout the project, communication between ABC Construction and the City of Riverton has been strained. ABC claims that requests for formal time extensions were met with vague responses, and the City did not provide timely acknowledgment of delays attributed to their responsibilities. The contractor states that the lack of clear communication resulted in misunderstandings and a lack of documented support for their extension claims.

5. **Penalties for Delay:**
   With the project’s completion now delayed beyond the contractual deadline, the City is poised to enforce the penalty clause as stipulated in the contract, which involves deducting 1% of the total project cost for each week past the deadline. ABC Construction, understanding the potential financial repercussions, insists that the delays were justifiable and that the penalties should not apply due to the mitigating factors they presented.

**Conclusion:**
As negotiations for resolution progress, both parties are at a standstill. ABC Construction is advocating for an extension that acknowledges the delays caused by permit issues, weather conditions, and change orders, as well as the associated additional costs. Conversely, the City of Riverton is reluctant to accept responsibility for penalties and has indicated a desire to hold the contractor accountable for the completed timeline. Mediation appears necessary to resolve these disputes before legal action ensues.
