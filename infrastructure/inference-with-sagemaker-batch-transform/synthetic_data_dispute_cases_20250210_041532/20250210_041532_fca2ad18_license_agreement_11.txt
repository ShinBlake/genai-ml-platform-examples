Theme: License Agreement
Case Number: 11
--------------------------------------------------

**Scenario: Contract Dispute Over License Agreement**

**Parties Involved:**
1. **ABC Software Inc.** (Licensor) - A company that develops and sells software solutions for small businesses.
2. **XYZ Tech Solutions** (Licensee) - A mid-sized IT consulting firm that specializes in implementing software solutions for clients.

**Background:**
In January 2022, ABC Software Inc. entered into a License Agreement with XYZ Tech Solutions, granting XYZ non-exclusive rights to use, distribute, and promote ABC's flagship software, "BusinessPro," for a period of three years. The agreement included a royalty structure where XYZ would pay ABC 15% of the net revenue generated from sales of the software, and an upfront licensing fee of $50,000, which was paid upon signing.

**Key Issues of Contention:**

1. **Royalties Calculation Dispute:**
   ABC Software claims that XYZ has underreported sales and therefore owes an additional $100,000 in royalties. ABC alleges that XYZ's calculations exclude significant sales made in Q3 and Q4 of 2022. XYZ counters that the figures are accurate, citing that certain sales were discounted, and those sales do not constitute "net revenue" as defined in the License Agreement. The definition of "net revenue" is ambiguous in the contract, leading to confusion and disagreement about what constitutes revenue that is subject to royalties.

2. **Unauthorized Modifications:**
   ABC Software also accuses XYZ Tech Solutions of making unauthorized modifications to the software, which violates the License Agreement's stipulation that prohibits any alterations without prior written consent. XYZ asserts that these changes were necessary to better integrate the software with their existing systems and that FAQ updates were clearly outlined in a verbal agreement with an ABC representative. ABC denies the existence of any verbal agreement and insists that any modifications must go through established channels as per the License Agreement.

3. **Termination Clause Ambiguity:**
   The License Agreement contains a termination clause detailing the circumstances under which either party can terminate the contract. After the dispute arose, XYZ invoked this clause, stating that ABC had failed to provide necessary software updates and technical support, which they argue constitutes a breach of contract. ABC, however, denies the claim, stating that they provided all necessary support as per the terms and within the obligations defined in the agreement. The ambiguity surrounding the timeline and definition of "necessary support" is at the heart of the contention.

4. **Legal Action and Damages:**
   Following failed attempts at mediation, ABC Software filed a lawsuit against XYZ Tech Solutions for breach of contract, seeking both the outstanding royalties and damages for loss of business reputation and potential future earnings. XYZ has counterclaimed for damages resulting from ABC’s alleged failure to provide the agreed-upon support and unauthorized termination of the agreement, seeking compensation for lost business opportunities as a result of the software’s reduced functionality.

**Conclusion:**
The dispute between ABC Software Inc. and XYZ Tech Solutions encapsulates issues of financial accountability, contractual obligations, and the enforceability of verbal agreements. With both parties aligned in litigation, the potential for negotiation appears slim, indicating a protracted legal battle ahead. The resolution hinges on the interpretation of the License Agreement's terms and conditions as they relate to both parties' operational practices and expectations.
