Theme: Notice Requirements
Case Number: 6
--------------------------------------------------

**Contract Dispute Scenario: Notice Requirements**

**Parties Involved:**
1. **ABC Construction Inc.** (the Contractor)
2. **Smith Green Development LLC** (the Client)

**Background:**
ABC Construction Inc. was contracted by Smith Green Development LLC to build a commercial office complex in downtown Metro City. The contract, signed in January 2023, stipulated a completion timeline of six months and included specific notice requirements for any changes or delays in the project schedule. 

**Key Issues and Dispute:**
In June 2023, the project encountered significant delays due to unforeseen environmental conditions discovered during excavation, notably the presence of hazardous waste that had not been disclosed during pre-construction surveys. ABC Construction informed Smith Green Development verbally about the issue but did not submit a formal written notice as specified in the contract’s notice provision.

By mid-July, Smith Green Development, frustrated with what they perceived as a lack of communication and transparency, sent a formal notice to ABC Construction stating that they were in default of the contract. They cited the lack of a written notice about the delays and demanded a detailed explanation along with a revised project timeline.

ABC Construction, in response, argued that the hazardous waste issue constituted a legitimate delay and contended that their verbal communication sufficed to meet the notice provision’s intent, which aimed to ensure that both parties were informed of material changes. However, they acknowledged that they had failed to deliver a written notice within the required timeframe as stipulated in Section 5.2 of the contract.

The crux of the dispute centers around:

1. **Notice Requirements**: ABC Construction’s failure to provide the required written notice within five business days of becoming aware of the potential delay directly contradicts the explicit terms of the contract. This led Smith Green Development to claim they were not adequately notified and were thus unable to make timely decisions regarding project funding and overall scheduling.

2. **Default and Remedies**: Smith Green Development is asserting that the lack of proper notice constituted a breach of contract, putting them in a position to pursue remedies, including potential termination of the contract or financial penalties. ABC Construction argues that the delays were unavoidable and lawful under the contract’s force majeure clause, which they believe absolves them from liability for the delay, notwithstanding the notice requirement.

3. **Communication and Good Faith**: Smith Green Development is also questioning the good faith of ABC Construction's handling of the delay notification. They argue that the failure to follow notice procedures reflects an overall lack of transparency, which undermines the trust necessary for a successful partnership. Conversely, ABC Construction claims that their attempts to communicate the problem verbally demonstrate their commitment to maintaining open dialogue and collaboration.

**Conclusion:**
The parties are currently seeking mediation to resolve the dispute, with each side maintaining opposing views on the interpretation and enforcement of the notice requirements in the contract. As the deadline approaches for the project’s completion, the stakes are high, and both parties are keen to find a resolution that preserves their business relationship.
