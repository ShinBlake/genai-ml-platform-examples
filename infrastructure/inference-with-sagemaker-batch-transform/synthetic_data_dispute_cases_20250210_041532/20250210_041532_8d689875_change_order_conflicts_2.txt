Theme: Change Order Conflicts
Case Number: 2
--------------------------------------------------

**Contract Dispute Scenario: Change Order Conflicts**

**Parties Involved:**
1. **Infratech Construction Company (Contractor)** - A mid-sized construction firm specializing in commercial projects.
2. **Greenfield Development Corp. (Client)** - A property development company overseeing the construction of a new office building.

**Background:**
Infratech was contracted to build a five-story office building for Greenfield Development. The contract specified a project completion date of April 30, 2023, with a total sum of $2 million. It included clauses for potential change orders addressing modifications in labor or materials required to complete the project. 

**Key Issues:**
1. **Scope Changes:**
   In January 2023, a significant change was requested by Greenfield to modify the building’s interior design, necessitating a complete redesign of certain structural elements and changes to the HVAC system. The initial design was based on a traditional layout, but the new request included open-plan offices and additional conference rooms. The contractor submitted a change order detailing the increased costs and extended timeline, which amounted to an additional $250,000 and an extension of the completion date by six weeks.

2. **Disputed Change Order Approval:**
   Greenfield’s project manager, Sarah Lentz, expressed that the change order was overpriced and that the modifications could be executed with minimal adjustments. Greenfield subsequently rejected the proposed change order and suggested an alternative approach that would limit the costs to $100,000, which Infratech felt was impractical given the redesign's complexity.

3. **Delay Claims:**
   Due to the unresolved change order, the contractor halted work on the project for three weeks as they awaited approval on the redesign. Greenfield argues that Infratech should not have suspended work and instead should have proceeded with the project as per the original contract. This work suspension has led to pushbacks on the overall project timeline, with Greenfield claiming it has now jeopardized the planned lease agreements for the new office space.

4. **Documentation Discrepancies:**
   Both parties are engaged in a dispute over documentation. Infratech claims to have kept meticulous records of all communications and submitted documentation regarding the change order requests. Conversely, Greenfield contends that the documentation provided by Infratech lacks proper details concerning the necessity and justification for each cost incurred, thereby undermining the validity of their claims.

5. **Financial Implications:**
   As a result of the dispute, Greenfield has reserved payments totaling $300,000 pending resolution of the change order conflict. Infratech argues this withholding constitutes a breach of contract and places financial strain on their operations, as they had already incurred additional labor and material costs in anticipation of project progression.

**Conclusion:**
The conflict has escalated with both parties considering legal action. Greenfield believes they can mitigate costs with alternative designs, while Infratech stands firm that the requested changes justify their initial change order submission. The case now hinges on interpretation of the contract’s language regarding change orders and work suspension policies, as both parties weigh their next steps in resolving this escalating conflict.
