**Scenario: Contract Dispute Over Rental Property Terms**

**Parties Involved:**
1. **John Smith** (Landlord) - Owner of a duplex in downtown Seattle.
2. **Maria Gonzalez** (Tenant) - A young professional who recently signed a lease for one of the duplex units.

**Background:**
In January 2023, John Smith and Maria Gonzalez entered into a lease agreement for the duplex, effective from February 1, 2023, to January 31, 2024. The lease detailed the monthly rent, a security deposit, and terms for maintenance and repair responsibilities. Notably, the contract included a clause stating that "the landlord is responsible for general maintenance, while the tenant is responsible for minor repairs up to and including $100 in costs."

**Dispute:**
By mid-April 2023, several maintenance issues arose in the unit occupied by Maria, including a leaky kitchen faucet and a malfunctioning heating system. In accordance with the lease, Maria attempted to resolve the issues by contacting John, but he was slow to respond. After two weeks of waiting with no action taken, Maria opted to hire a plumber for the faucet, which cost her $90. She also contacted a heating technician, who informed her that the heating system needed an extensive repair costing $300, well above the $100 threshold defined in their lease.

John was alerted to the situation and expressed frustration in a text message, arguing that Maria should have consulted him before hiring a plumber. Maria believed the contract allowed her to make minor repairs without prior approval, considering the urgency of the leaky faucet. Additionally, she argued that the heating issue was John's responsibility, as it involved general maintenance for which he was contracted to handle.

John countered that Maria misinterpreted the "minor repairs" clause, insisting it only encompassed straightforward issues that did not require professional expertise. He argued that hiring a plumber without his consent violated the terms of their agreement. Furthermore, he claimed that the heating system repair exceeded normal expectations of tenant responsibility, and he was ready to contest Maria's right to seek reimbursement for the plumbing work.

**Key Issues:**
1. **Interpretation of “Minor Repairs”**: The primary contention rests on whether the lease's definition of "minor repairs" grants Maria the autonomy to make decisions regarding urgent issues, particularly when the landlord's response is delayed.
   
2. **Communication and Responsiveness**: John’s lack of timely communication may have implications for his responsibilities under the lease. Maria argues that his inaction necessitated her intervention, while John feels she should have waited for his response.

3. **Scope of Responsibilities**: The dispute raises questions about what constitutes general maintenance versus minor repairs, particularly with complex systems such as heating. This distinction is critical in determining the accountability of both parties.

4. **Financial Reimbursement and Obligations**: As issues escalate, the question of whether John is responsible for reimbursing Maria for her incurred expenses will necessitate legal adjudication, with each party presenting their interpretation of the lease agreement. 

This dispute serves as a classic example of how ambiguous language in contracts can lead to significant disagreements between landlords and tenants, potentially escalating into legal actions if not resolved amicably.
