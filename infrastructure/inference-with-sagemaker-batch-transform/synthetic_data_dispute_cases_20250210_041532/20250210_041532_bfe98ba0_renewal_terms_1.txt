Theme: Renewal Terms
Case Number: 1
--------------------------------------------------

**Scenario: Contract Dispute over Renewal Terms**

**Parties Involved:**
1. **TechSolutions Inc.** (Party A) – A software development company specializing in custom CRM platforms.
2. **BusinessPro LLC** (Party B) – A mid-sized retail company that has been using TechSolutions’ software for three years.

**Background:**
TechSolutions Inc. and BusinessPro LLC entered into a 3-year service agreement on January 1, 2020, for the provision and maintenance of a customized CRM system. The contract contained a clause regarding automatic renewal, stating that the agreement would automatically renew for an additional year unless either party provided written notice of termination at least 60 days prior to the expiration date. 

The original contract outlined an annual renewal fee, with a 5% increase applied each year—a common practice to account for inflation and increased service costs. 

**Key Issues:**
As the contract reached its expiration on December 31, 2022, BusinessPro LLC chose not to act on the auto-renewal clause. The retail company’s leadership evaluated its software needs and decided to explore alternatives, believing they could find a more cost-effective solution. An internal memo was circulated on September 1, 2022, indicating that the team should be prepared for potential changes in software providers.

However, due to a clerical error, the memo was never shared with the legal department, which oversees contractual obligations. On November 15, 2022, the CEO of BusinessPro LLC expressed verbal hesitation about continuing the contract during a call with TechSolutions’ account manager, stating that they might not require the service moving forward.

On December 20, 2022, TechSolutions Inc. sent a renewal invoice reflecting the increased fee for the upcoming term. BusinessPro LLC received the invoice but did not act upon it, mistakenly believing that their non-response would negate the auto-renewal clause.

As of January 1, 2023, TechSolutions continued providing services, accessing BusinessPro’s systems as per the renewed contract. Subsequently, in mid-January, BusinessPro received an unexpected bill for the new fee structure, prompting them to engage in discussions with TechSolutions.

**Dispute:**
When BusinessPro expressed their intention to terminate services effective immediately, TechSolutions argued that the auto-renewal had indeed taken effect since no formal termination had been communicated within the stipulated timeline. They pointed to the clause that clearly stated the obligation to provide written notice at least 60 days before the renewal period.

Conversely, BusinessPro contended that the verbal communication on November 15 suggested their intent not to renew, along with the internal memo that had been mismanaged. They claimed that TechSolutions should have understood that they were not interested in continuing the service.

**Conclusion:**
The parties are now in negotiation over the obligation to adhere to the renewal terms. TechSolutions seeks to enforce the renewal and payment of the new fees, while BusinessPro aims to terminate the agreement without additional costs. Both parties are considering mediation to resolve the dispute amicably, amidst concerns of reputational risk and future business engagements.
