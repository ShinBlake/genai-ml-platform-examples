--------------------------------------------------

**Contract Dispute Scenario: Force Majeure Claims**

**Parties Involved:**

1. **GreenTech Solar Inc. (Claimant)** - A solar panel manufacturer based in California.
2. **BlueSky Energy Solutions Ltd. (Respondent)** - A national solar installation company based in Texas.

**Background:**
In January 2021, GreenTech Solar Inc. entered into a supply contract with BlueSky Energy Solutions Ltd. for the delivery of 10,000 solar panels to be used in several solar farm projects across Texas. The contract stipulated that delivery was to be completed by March 30, 2021, with specific penalties for delays. A force majeure clause included in the contract excused either party from liability for delays caused by unforeseen events beyond their control, such as natural disasters, pandemics, or governmental actions.

**Dispute Timeline:**
In March 2021, a severe winter storm (Winter Storm Uri) struck Texas, causing widespread power outages and disrupting supply chains across the state. BlueSky Energy Solutions faced delays in accessing the necessary installation sites due to hazardous conditions. On March 15, 2021, BlueSky notified GreenTech that they would be unable to accept delivery of the solar panels by the agreed deadline due to the storm's effects and formally invoked the force majeure clause.

**Key Issues in Dispute:**

1. **Extent of Impact:** 
   GreenTech contends that the storm’s impact did not justify a force majeure claim because the manufacturing facility in California was operational and capable of delivering the panels on time. They argue that BlueSky’s inability to procure installation permits and their lack of contingency planning contributed to the delay.

2. **Notification Protocol:** 
   GreenTech alleges that BlueSky did not follow the notification protocol outlined in the contract, which required written notice of a force majeure event within 48 hours. BlueSky's notice came 25 days after the storm began, which GreenTech deems unacceptable and indicative of poor project management.

3. **Causation of Delay:** 
   GreenTech questions the causal relationship between the storm and BlueSky’s delayed projects. They claim that BlueSky could have pre-emptively organized alternative arrangements or resources to mitigate the delay, thus undermining their force majeure claim.

4. **Future Performance and Damages:** 
   With the original contract default of March 30, GreenTech has incurred additional costs and is seeking compensatory damages for the inability to meet its subsequent supply commitments to other clients. BlueSky, on the other hand, argues that the damage incurred is unjust, as they should be exempt from penalties due to the storm's unforeseeable nature.

5. **Mitigation Efforts:** 
   Both parties are at odds over the issue of mitigation. GreenTech argues that BlueSky had a responsibility to mitigate potential losses caused by the storm, while BlueSky insists that the unprecedented scale of the winter storm rendered them unable to take alternative actions.

**Conclusion:**
The dispute centers around the interpretation and application of the force majeure clause, the notification process followed by BlueSky, and whether the winter storm constituted a valid excuse for the delay. Resolution is sought through mediation with potential litigation looming should an agreement not be reached.
