Case Number: 16

**Contract Dispute Scenario: TechCo vs. BuildRight**

**Background:**
TechCo, a software development company, entered into a contract with BuildRight, a construction firm, to develop a customized project management software system. The agreement, signed on January 15, 2023, stipulated a completion deadline of July 15, 2023, with a total payment of $150,000, divided into three installments: $50,000 upon signing, $50,000 upon delivery of the beta version, and the final $50,000 upon successful implementation and training.

**Parties Involved:**
1. **TechCo**: A software company specializing in project management solutions with a solid reputation for delivering on time.
2. **BuildRight**: A mid-sized construction firm looking to streamline operations through the implementation of new software.

**Key Issues:**

1. **Delayed Deliverables**: TechCo failed to deliver the beta version of the software by the agreed deadline of May 15, 2023. The delay was attributed to unforeseen technical challenges related to integrating existing construction management tools with the new software. BuildRight contends that TechCo did not communicate these challenges in a timely manner, leading to operational setbacks.

2. **Quality of Work**: Upon receiving the beta version on July 10, 2023, BuildRight raised concerns about the software's functionality, claiming it was riddled with bugs and did not meet the agreed-upon specifications. Specifically, BuildRight asserted that key features, such as mobile access and real-time project updates, were either incomplete or malfunctioning. TechCo responded that the software was delivered as per the initial specifications and that the issues reported were part of the normal development process.

3. **Payment Dispute**: Following the incomplete software delivery and quality concerns, BuildRight withheld the second payment of $50,000, arguing that the software did not satisfy the deliverables outlined in the contract. TechCo insisted that withholding payment constituted a breach of contract and demanded the outstanding balance.

4. **Breach of Contract Claim**: TechCo alleges that BuildRightâ€™s refusal to pay has resulted in financial harm and legal costs. TechCo is asserting that BuildRight has unilaterally decided not to abide by the payment terms even though the contract stipulates payment upon delivery of the beta version, which TechCo argues was completed, albeit with minor issues.

5. **Resolution Attempts**: Both parties have attempted to resolve the dispute amicably. TechCo offered to fix the reported bugs and provide additional support at no extra cost, but BuildRight remains hesitant, citing a lack of trust due to the initial delays and quality issues.

**Conclusion:**
The dispute centers around the main points of contention: the interpretation of the delivery timeline, the quality and functionality of the software, and the justification for withholding payment. TechCo argues that they met their contractual obligations, while BuildRight claims that breaches of contract warrant withholding payment and potentially terminating the agreement. Both parties are now considering mediation to avoid protracted litigation, aiming for a resolution that allows them to move forward with their respective operations.
