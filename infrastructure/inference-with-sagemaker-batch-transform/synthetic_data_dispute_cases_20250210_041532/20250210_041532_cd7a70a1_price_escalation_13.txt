Theme: Price Escalation
Case Number: 13
--------------------------------------------------

**Scenario: Contract Dispute over Price Escalation between BuildCorp and EcoMaterials**

**Background:**
BuildCorp, a large construction firm, entered into a contract with EcoMaterials, a supplier of sustainable building materials, for the supply of eco-friendly plywood for a high-rise residential project in downtown. The contract was signed in January 2023, with a total project cost estimated at $5 million. Due to the projectâ€™s complexity and market volatility, both parties agreed to a price escalation clause, which was triggered by increases in raw material costs.

**Parties Involved:**
1. **BuildCorp** - General Contractor
2. **EcoMaterials** - Supplier of Plywood

**Key Issues Contention:**

1. **Triggering of Price Escalation Clause:**
   - BuildCorp contends that EcoMaterials improperly invoked the price escalation clause in March 2023, following a 20% increase in the price of raw wood. BuildCorp argues that the increase was due to seasonal fluctuations, which they believe does not qualify for a price adjustment under the agreed terms of the contract. The contract specifies that only extraordinary and sustained increases in raw material costs would justify a price escalation.

2. **Documentation and Transparency:**
   - EcoMaterials claims that they provided adequate documentation supporting their position, including invoices from their suppliers showing a dramatic rise in costs due to supply chain disruptions stemming from geopolitical issues and natural disasters. However, BuildCorp asserts that the documentation was insufficient and lacks clarity, arguing that many of the invoices were not dated appropriately or reflected padding of cost to justify the escalation.

3. **Notification Requirements:**
   - Another contention is the notification requirement stipulated in the contract. BuildCorp states that EcoMaterials failed to provide timely notice about the price increase, as the contract mandates that notification must occur within seven days of the price change. EcoMaterials responds that they notified BuildCorp immediately; however, the communication was lost among other project correspondence.

4. **Disputing New Pricing:**
   - After EcoMaterials invoked the price escalation clause, they proposed an increase of 15% on the existing contract prices. BuildCorp argues this percentage is excessive and not proportionate to the market increase they believe occurred. They request a third-party audit of raw material pricing trends to validate EcoMaterials' claims.

5. **Impact on Project Timeline and Costs:**
   - The price escalation has led to discussions about potential delays. BuildCorp fears that escalating costs could put the project over budget and lead to a breach of contract with their client if the deadline is missed. EcoMaterials maintains that they are willing to work with BuildCorp on flexible delivery schedules in light of the new pricing but insists an adjustment is necessary to stay profitable.

**Conclusion:**
Both parties are currently in negotiations to resolve the dispute, but tensions remain high as BuildCorp seeks to limit additional costs while EcoMaterials requests fair compensation for their increased expenses. The matter may lead to mediation unless a mutually beneficial revision to the contract terms is reached promptly.
