Theme: Intellectual Property Rights
Case Number: 20
--------------------------------------------------

**Contract Dispute Scenario: Intellectual Property Rights**

**Parties Involved:**

1. **TechInnovate LLC** (Plaintiff) - A mid-sized software development firm specializing in artificial intelligence and machine learning applications. 
   
2. **CleverDesign Inc.** (Defendant) - A design agency that focuses on creating user interfaces for mobile and web applications.

**Background:**

In January 2022, TechInnovate and CleverDesign entered into a contract for the development of a new AI-driven mobile application called "SmartGuide." The agreement stipulated that CleverDesign would create the user interface and visual assets, while TechInnovate would develop the software architecture and backend functionalities. The contract included specific clauses regarding intellectual property rights (IPR), ownership, and revenue sharing.

**Key Issues:**

1. **Ownership of Created Assets:**
   The contract specified that all intellectual property generated during the project would belong to TechInnovate upon full payment for design services. However, CleverDesign maintains that they retain ownership of the unique design elements created for SmartGuide, arguing that their design was a "custom work" that automatically grants them copyright ownership unless explicitly transferred. This has led to Conflicts over the scope of what constitutes useable and transferable intellectual property.

2. **Revenue Sharing Dispute:**
   According to the contract, the parties agreed to share 20% of the application’s revenue with CleverDesign for a period of three years post-launch in exchange for their contribution. However, after the application launch in July 2022, TechInnovate reported low revenue, attributing this to market conditions. CleverDesign contends that TechInnovate has not provided transparent financial statements and is underreporting revenue. They suspect that TechInnovate might be diverting profits through various means.

3. **Non-Competition and Non-Disclosure Clauses:**
   The contract included a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) prohibiting CleverDesign from sharing project details or competing with TechInnovate for two years following the partnership's termination. CleverDesign recently learned that TechInnovate had shared critical project details with third parties, thereby violating the NDA. This breach by TechInnovate adds another layer of conflict, as CleverDesign now threatens legal action based on the perceived violation of trust and loss of potential business opportunities.

4. **Contractual Inconsistencies:**
   CleverDesign’s attorneys argue that the contract lacks clarity regarding the definition and scope of the “IP rights” and the “custom work” clause. Furthermore, they claim that the vague language can lead to differing interpretations, making it difficult for both parties to agree on what exactly was to be included in the ownership transfer.

**Conclusion:**

As the disputes escalate, both parties are considering mediation, recognizing that a protracted legal battle could harm their reputations and future business opportunities. TechInnovate seeks to uphold the contract's terms, believing they have the upper hand with their contributions to technology, while CleverDesign strives to protect their creative assets and insists on a fair revenue share based on their initial agreement.
