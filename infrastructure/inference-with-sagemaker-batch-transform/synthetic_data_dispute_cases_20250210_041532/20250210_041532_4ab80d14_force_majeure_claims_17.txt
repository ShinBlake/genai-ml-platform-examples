Case Number: 17
--------------------------------------------------

**Contract Dispute Scenario: Force Majeure Claims**

**Parties Involved:**
1. **GreenTech Innovations, Inc.** (the "Supplier"): A leading manufacturer of solar panels based in California, specializing in sustainable energy solutions.
2. **Skyward Energy LLC.** (the "Buyer"): A regional distributor of renewable energy products based in New Mexico, responsible for retailing solar panels and other green technology to residential and commercial clients.

**Background:**
In January 2023, GreenTech and Skyward entered into a purchase agreement for the supply of 10,000 solar panels to be delivered by June 30, 2023. The contract included standard terms regarding delivery timelines, pricing, and a force majeure clause stating that neither party would be liable for delays caused by events beyond their reasonable control, such as natural disasters, strikes, or pandemics.

**Dispute Overview:**
In early June 2023, just weeks before the scheduled delivery, GreenTech announced that it could not fulfill the order due to a severe wildfire that devastated its manufacturing plant in California. The fire was classified as a force majeure event, and GreenTech claimed it was unable to produce the solar panels as a result. 

Skyward Energy, having pre-sold most of the ordered panels to customers, faced potential financial loss from missed sales opportunities. Instead of accepting the delay, Skyward demanded an immediate shipment of any available panels. GreenTech responded that they could provide only a partial shipment and requested an extension for the remainder of the order.

**Key Issues:**

1. **Applicability of Force Majeure:**
   - Skyward contests GreenTech’s claim of force majeure, arguing that the company should have had contingency plans in place for natural disasters, particularly given their location in a wildfire-prone area.
   - GreenTech maintains that the extent of the damage was unprecedented and that all reasonable steps were taken to mitigate the impact of the wildfire.

2. **Notification Requirements:**
   - The contract stipulates that the party invoking force majeure must provide written notice within five days of the event. Skyward argues that GreenTech failed to provide timely notification of the fire’s impact on its operations.
   - GreenTech insists that it communicated its inability to fulfill the order as soon as it was determined, arguing that the short timeframe of five days did not allow for an accurate assessment of the situation.

3. **Mitigation of Damages:**
   - Skyward accuses GreenTech of failing to take adequate steps to mitigate damages, such as sourcing panels from third-party manufacturers or providing alternatives. They claim that GreenTech’s lack of proactive management has exacerbated the situation.
   - GreenTech contends that due to the scale of the disaster, no third-party manufacturers could meet the required specifications or timelines, thus limiting their options for mitigation.

4. **Financial Liability:**
   - Skyward is seeking compensation for lost sales and reputational damage due to failure to deliver the promised goods, while GreenTech is adamant that they should not be held liable for losses arising from the force majeure event.

**Conclusion:**
The dispute escalated, leading both parties to consider legal action. Mediation has been proposed to facilitate dialogue, but as of October 2023, both parties remain at an impasse regarding the interpretation of the force majeure clause and the obligations it imposes.
