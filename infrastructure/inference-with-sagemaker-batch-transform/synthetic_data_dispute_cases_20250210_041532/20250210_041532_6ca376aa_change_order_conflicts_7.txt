Case Number: 7
--------------------------------------------------

**Scenario: Change Order Conflict in the ABC Plaza Construction Project**

**Parties Involved:**
1. **Builder Corp.** - The general contractor responsible for the construction of the ABC Plaza.
2. **City Developments LLC** - The owner of the property and the client overseeing the project.

**Project Overview:**
The ABC Plaza construction project, valued at $5 million, was initiated to create a mixed-use development featuring retail spaces and apartments. The project began in January 2023 and was expected to be completed by June 2024.

**Background of Dispute:**
In March 2023, City Developments LLC requested several changes to the original plans, driven by new zoning regulations and community feedback. Builder Corp. submitted a Change Order #1, detailing the additional costs associated with the requested modifications, which totaled $150,000 and extended the project timeline by two months.

The Change Order was reviewed, and City Developments approved it, acknowledging the necessity of the amendments to comply with zoning laws. However, in April 2023, the City issued Change Order #2, which included further modifications to the project's scope, adding features such as enhanced landscaping and additional parking spaces to address community concerns. The costs proposed by Builder Corp. escalated to an additional $200,000.

**Key Issues of Contention:**

1. **Scope of Work:**
   City Developments asserts that Builder Corp. should have anticipated the need for additional work based on standard industry practices. They argue that the scope outlined in the initial contract should have covered any foreseeable zoning-related changes, and therefore the costs associated with Change Order #2 should be absorbed by Builder Corp.

2. **Cost Justification:**
Builder Corp. contends that the expenses associated with both change orders reflect the substantial alterations requested by City Developments. They argue that the changes were extensive and required additional labor, materials, and re-engineering of certain project components. Builder Corp. maintains that they are entitled to a fair compensation for these unforeseen costs.

3. **Timeliness of Approvals:**
Another point of contention is the delay in approvals from City Developments. Builder Corp. claims that the slow response to Change Order #1 extended the project timeline unnecessarily and incurred additional costs due to increased labor and material price inflation since they had already mobilized their workforce based on the initial schedule. Conversely, City Developments argues that Builder Corp. had ample time to adjust work schedules based on the anticipated changes.

4. **Document and Communication Gaps:**
Both parties have identified inconsistencies in documentation and communication regarding the changes. City Developments argues that some of the change requests were verbal and not documented formally, while Builder Corp. claims that they documented their understanding of the initial requests and that any lack of clarity lies with City Developmentsâ€™ failure to provide a detailed written description of their requirements.

**Conclusion:**
The conflict escalated to a formal dispute through an alternate dispute resolution process as both parties sought to resolve their differences without halting construction. An independent mediator was engaged to assist in negotiating an equitable resolution, addressing the financial implications and exploring the possibility of a revised timeline that would satisfy both parties.
